<p><a href="/wiki/Stanley_Wasserman" title="Stanley Wasserman">Stanley Wasserman</a> and Katherine Faust cautioned that "there is considerable disagreement among social scientists about the definitions of the related concepts of <a href="/wiki/Social_position" title="Social position">social position</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_status" title="Social status">social status</a>, and social role." They note that while many scholars differentiate those terms, they can define those terms in a way that clashes with the definitions of another scholar; for example they state that "<a href="/wiki/Ralph_Linton" title="Ralph Linton">[Ralph] Linton</a> uses the term 'status' in a way that is identical to our use of the term "position".<sup id="cite_ref-WassermanFaust1994_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WassermanFaust1994-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Roles may be <a href="/wiki/Achieved_status" title="Achieved status">achieved</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ascribed_status" title="Ascribed status">ascribed</a> or they can be accidental in different situations. An <i>achieved role</i> is a position that a person assumes voluntarily which reflects personal skills, abilities, and effort. An <i>ascribed role</i> is a position assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and is usually forced upon a person.
</p><p>Roles can be semi-permanent ("<a href="/wiki/Physician" title="Physician">doctor</a>", "mother", "child"), or they can be transitory. A well-known example is the <i><a href="/wiki/Sick_role" title="Sick role">sick role</a></i> as formulated by <a href="/wiki/Talcott_Parsons" title="Talcott Parsons">Talcott Parsons</a> in the late 1940s. In the transitory "sick role", a person is exempted from their usual roles, but is expected to conform to transitory behavioral standards, such as following doctors' orders and trying to recover.
</p><p>For many roles, individuals must meet certain conditions, biological or sociological. For instance, a boy cannot ordinarily take the biological role of mother. Other roles require training or experience. For instance, in many cultures doctors must be educated and certified before practicing medicine.
</p><p>Role development can be influenced by a number of additional factors, including <a href="/wiki/Social" title="Social">social</a>, <a href="/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetic</a> predisposition, <a href="/wiki/Cultural" class="mw-redirect" title="Cultural">cultural</a> or <a href="/wiki/Situational" class="mw-redirect" title="Situational">situational</a>.
</p>
<ul><li>Societal influence: The structure of society often forms individuals into certain roles based on the social situations they choose to experience. Parents enrolling their children in certain programs at a young age increases the chance that the child will follow that role.</li>
<li>Genetic predisposition: People take on roles that come naturally to them. Those with athletic ability generally take on roles of athletes. Those with mental genius often take on roles devoted to education and knowledge. This does not mean that people must choose only one path, each individual can reprise multiple roles (i.e. Evelyn can be the point guard on the basketball team and the editor of her school newspaper).</li>
<li>Cultural influence: Different cultures place different values on certain roles based on their lifestyle. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">soccer</a> players are regarded higher in European countries than in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, where soccer is less popular.</li>
<li>Situational influence: Roles can be created or altered based on the situation a person is put in outside their own influence. An example of this is students blaming failure on situational factors like "the test wasn't fair" and this effects their role as a student.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Roles are also frequently interconnected in a <a href="/wiki/Role_set" title="Role set">role set</a>, that complement of role-relationships in which persons are involved by virtue of occupying a particular social status.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> For example, a high school football player carries the roles of student, athlete, classmate, etc. Another example of a role is "an individual in the role of a parent is expected to care for their child and protect them from harm".<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>

By unspoken consensus, certain behaviors are deemed "appropriate" and others "inappropriate". For example, an appropriate <a href="/wiki/Physician" title="Physician">doctor</a> dresses fairly conservatively, asks a series of personal questions about one's health, touches one in ways that would normally be forbidden, writes <a href="/wiki/Medical_prescription" title="Medical prescription">prescriptions</a>, and shows more concern for the personal <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_life" title="Quality of life">wellbeing</a> of his or her clients than is expected of, say, an <a href="/wiki/Electrician" title="Electrician">electrician</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Shopkeeper" title="Shopkeeper">shopkeeper</a>.
</p><p>"Role" is what the doctor <i>does</i> (or, at least, is expected to do) while status is what the doctor  <i>is; </i>in other words, "status" is the position an actor occupies, while "role" is the expected behavior attached to that position.  Roles are not limited to occupational status, of course, nor does the fact that one is cast in the role of "doctor" during working hours prevent one from taking on other roles at other times: husband/wife, friend, father/mother, and so on.

<p>In interactionist social theory, the concept of role is crucial. The interactionist definition of "role" pre-dates the functionalist one. A role, in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals in a tentative, creative way. <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">Philosopher</a> <a href="/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead" title="George Herbert Mead">George Herbert Mead</a> explored roles in his seminal 1934 work, <i>Mind, self and society</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Mead's main interest was the way in which children learn how to become a part of society by imaginative <i>role-taking</i>, observing and mimicking others. This is always done in an interactive way: it's not meaningful to think of a role for one person alone, only for that person as an individual who is both co-operating and competing with others. Adults behave similarly: taking roles from those that they see around them, adapting them in creative ways, and (by the process of social interaction) testing them and either confirming them or modifying them. This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable <a href="/wiki/Ambiguity" title="Ambiguity">ambiguity</a>, but is nevertheless something that is part of all social interactions: each individual actively tries to "define the situation" (understand their role within it); choose a role that is advantageous or appealing; play that role; and persuade others to support the role.

<p><a href="/wiki/Social_norms_approach" title="Social norms approach">Social norms theory</a> states that much of people's behavior is influenced by their perception of how other members of their <a href="/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups" class="mw-redirect" title="Ingroups and outgroups">social group</a> behave. When individuals are in a state of <a href="/wiki/Deindividuation" title="Deindividuation">deindividuation</a>, they see themselves only in terms of group identity, and their behavior is likely to be guided by group norms alone. But while group norms have a powerful effect on behavior, they can only guide behavior when they are activated by obvious reminders or by subtle cues. People adhere to social norms through enforcement, internalization, the sharing of norms by other group members, and frequent activation.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Norms can be enforced through punishment or reward. Individuals are rewarded for living up to their roles (i.e. students getting an "A" on their exam) or punished for not completing the duties of their role (i.e. a salesman is fired for not selling enough product).
</p><p>Social norm theory has been applied as an environmental approach, with an aim of influencing individuals by manipulating their <a href="/wiki/Social_environment" title="Social environment">social and cultural environments</a>. It has been widely applied using <a href="/wiki/Social_marketing" title="Social marketing">social marketing</a> techniques.

<p>As described in <i>Working in Groups</i> by Engleberg and Wynn, team role theory is when "members assume roles that are compatible with their personal characteristics and skills". <a href="/wiki/Meredith_Belbin" title="Meredith Belbin">Meredith Belbin</a>, a psychologist, first explored the concept of team-role theory in the 1970s when he and his research team went about observing teams and wanted to find out what made teams work and what did not. According to Belbin and his research team "the research revealed that the difference between success and failure for a team was not dependent on factors such as intellect, but more on behavior".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> They began to identify separate clusters of behaviors and found that behavior was more influential on a team than anything else. These separate clusters of behaviors are known as the "Team Roles".  The nine "team roles" are as follows: coordinator/chairperson, shaper, innovator, resource investigator, monitor/evaluator, implementer, teamworker, completer/finisher, and specialist.

<p>Role confusion occurs in a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he or she should play, but where the roles are not necessarily incompatible.
