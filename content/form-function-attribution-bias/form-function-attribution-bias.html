<p>Research on <a href="/wiki/Attribution_bias#attribution_bias" title="Attribution bias">attribution biases</a> is founded in <a href="/wiki/Attribution_theory" class="mw-redirect" title="Attribution theory">attribution theory</a>, which was proposed to explain why and how people create meaning about others' and their own behavior. This theory focuses on identifying how an observer uses information in his/her social environment in order to create a causal explanation for events. Attribution theory also provides explanations for why different people can interpret the same event in different ways and what factors contribute to attribution biases.<sup id="cite_ref-Himmelfarb_1974_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Himmelfarb_1974-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Psychologist <a href="/wiki/Fritz_Heider" title="Fritz Heider">Fritz Heider</a> first discussed attributions in his 1958 book, <i>The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Heider_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Heider-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Heider made several contributions that laid the foundation for further research on attribution theory and attribution biases. He noted that people tend to make distinctions between behaviors that are caused by personal disposition versus environmental or situational conditions. He also predicted that people are more likely to explain others' behavior in terms of dispositional factors (i.e., caused by a given person's personality), while ignoring the surrounding situational demands.

<p>Building on <a href="/wiki/Attribution_bias#Fritz_Heider" title="Attribution bias">Heider's</a> early work, other psychologists in the 1960s and 1970s extended work on attributions by offering additional related theories. In 1965, social psychologists Edward E. Jones and Keith Davis proposed an explanation for patterns of attribution termed <i>correspondent inference theory</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_and_Davis_1965_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones_and_Davis_1965-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  A correspondent inference assumes that a person's behavior reflects a stable disposition or personality characteristic instead of a situational factor. They explained that certain conditions make us more likely to make a correspondent inference about someone's behavior:
</p>
<ul><li>Intention: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when they interpret someone's behavior as intentional, rather than unintentional.</li>
<li>Social desirability: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when an actor's behavior is socially undesirable than when it is conventional.</li>
<li>Effects of behavior: People are more likely to make a correspondent, or dispositional, inference when someone else's actions yield outcomes that are rare or not yielded by other actions.</li></ul>

<p>Soon after <a href="/wiki/Attribution_bias#Jones_&amp;_Davis" title="Attribution bias">Jones and Davis</a> first proposed their correspondent inference theory, <a href="/wiki/Harold_Kelley" title="Harold Kelley">Harold Kelley</a>, a social psychologist famous for his work on interdependence theory as well as attribution theory, proposed a <i>covariation model</i> in 1973 to explain the way people make attributions.<sup id="cite_ref-Kelley_1967_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kelley_1967-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kelley_1973_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kelley_1973-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> This model helped to explain how people choose to attribute a behavior to an internal disposition versus an environmental factor. Kelley used the term 'covariation' to convey that when making attributions, people have access to information from many observations, across different situations, and at many time points; therefore, people can observe the way a behavior varies under these different conditions and draw conclusions based on that context. He proposed three factors that influence the way individuals explain behavior: 
</p>
<ul><li>Consensus: The extent to which other people behave in the same way. There is high consensus when most people behave consistent with a given action/actor. Low consensus is when not many people behave in this way.</li>
<li>Consistency: The extent to which a person usually behaves in a given way. There is high consistency when a person almost always behaves in a specific way. Low consistency is when a person almost never behaves like this.</li>
<li>Distinctiveness: The extent to which an actor's behavior in one situation is different from his/her behavior in other situations. There is high distinctiveness when an actor does not behave this way in most situations. Low distinctiveness is when an actor usually behaves in a particular way in most situations.</li></ul>
<p>Kelley proposed that people are more likely to make dispositional attributions when consensus is low (most other people don't behave in the same way), consistency is high (a person behaves this way across most situations), and distinctiveness is low (a person's behavior is not unique to this situation). Alternatively, situational attributions are more likely reached when consensus is high, consistency is low, and distinctiveness is high.<sup id="cite_ref-Kelley_1973_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kelley_1973-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> His research helped to reveal the specific mechanisms underlying the process of making attributions.

<p>As early researchers explored the way people make causal attributions, they also recognized that attributions do not necessarily reflect reality and can be colored by a person's own perspective.<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_and_Nisbett_1971_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones_and_Nisbett_1971-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Storms_1973_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Storms_1973-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Certain conditions can prompt people to exhibit attribution bias, or draw inaccurate conclusions about the cause of a given behavior or outcome. In his work on <a href="#Attribution_theory">attribution theory</a>, <a href="#Fritz_Heider">Fritz Heider</a> noted that in ambiguous situations, people make attributions based on their own wants and needs, which are therefore often skewed.<sup id="cite_ref-Heider_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Heider-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He also explained that this tendency was rooted in a need to maintain a positive <a href="/wiki/Self-concept" title="Self-concept">self-concept</a>, later termed the <a href="#Self-serving_bias">self-serving bias</a>.
</p><p>Kelley's covariation model also led to the acknowledgment of attribution biases.<sup id="cite_ref-Kelley_1973_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kelley_1973-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The model explained the conditions under which people will make informed dispositional versus situational attributions. But, it assumed that people had access to such information (i.e., the consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness of a person's behavior). When one doesn't have access to such information, like when they interact with a stranger, it will result in a tendency to take cognitive shortcuts, resulting in different types of attribution biases, such as the <a href="/wiki/Attribution_bias#Actor-observer_bias" title="Attribution bias">actor-observer bias</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_and_Nisbett_1971_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones_and_Nisbett_1971-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Although psychologists agreed that people are prone to these cognitive biases, there existed disagreement concerning the cause of such biases. On one hand, supporters of a "cognitive model" argued that biases were a product of human information processing constraints. One major proponent of this view was <a href="/wiki/Yale" class="mw-redirect" title="Yale">Yale</a> psychologist Michael Storms, who proposed this cognitive explanation following his 1973 study of social perception.<sup id="cite_ref-Storms_1973_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Storms_1973-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> In his experiment, participants viewed a conversation between two individuals, dubbed Actor One and Actor Two. Some participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor One, such that they were unable to see the front of Actor Two, while other participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor Two, obstructed from the front of Actor One.
</p><p>Following the conversation, participants were asked to make attributions about the conversationalists. Storms found that participants ascribed more causal influence to the person they were looking at. Thus, participants made different attributions about people depending on the information they had access to. Storms used these results to bolster his theory of cognitively-driven attribution biases; because people have no access to the world except through their own eyes, they are inevitably constrained and consequently prone to biases. Similarly, social psychologist <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Greenwald" title="Anthony Greenwald">Anthony Greenwald</a> described humans as possessing a <i>totalitarian ego</i>, meaning that people view the world through their own personal selves.<sup id="cite_ref-Greenwald_1980_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Greenwald_1980-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, different people may interpret the world differently and in turn reach different conclusions.

<p>Some researchers criticized the view that attributional biases are a sole product of information processing constraints, arguing that humans do not passively interpret their world and make attributions; rather, they are active and goal-driven beings. Building on this criticism, research began to focus on the role of motives in driving attribution biases.<sup id="cite_ref-Tetlock_and_Levi_1982_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Tetlock_and_Levi_1982-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Researchers such as <a href="/wiki/Ziva_Kunda" title="Ziva Kunda">Ziva Kunda</a> drew attention to the motivated aspects of attributions and attribution biases. Kunda in particular argued that certain biases only appear when people are presented with motivational pressures; therefore, they can't be exclusively explained by an objective cognitive process.<sup id="cite_ref-Kunda_1987_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kunda_1987-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> More specifically, people are more likely to construct biased social judgments when they are motivated to arrive at a particular conclusion, so long as they can justify this conclusion.<sup id="cite_ref-Kunda_1990_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kunda_1990-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Early researchers explained attribution biases as cognitively driven and a product of information processing errors. In the early 1980s, studies demonstrated that there may also be a motivational component to attribution biases, such that their own desires and emotions affect how one interprets social information.<sup id="cite_ref-Kunda_1990_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kunda_1990-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Zuckerman_1979_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Zuckerman_1979-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Current research continues to explore the validity of both of these explanations by examining the function of <a href="#Types_of_attribution_biases">specific types of attribution biases</a> and their behavioral correlates through a variety of methods (e.g., research with children or using <a href="/wiki/FMRI" class="mw-redirect" title="FMRI">brain imaging techniques</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-Connolly_and_Bukszar_1990_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Connolly_and_Bukszar_1990-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Runions_and_Keating_2007_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Runions_and_Keating_2007-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Blackwood_2003_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blackwood_2003-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>

Participants then responded to questions about their peer's intent. The children who played the violent video game were more likely to say that their peer harmed someone on purpose than the participants who played the nonviolent game. This finding provided evidence that exposure to violence and aggression could cause children to develop a short-term hostile attribution bias.

<p>Research has found that humans often exhibit attribution biases when interpreting the behavior of others, and specifically when explaining the behavior of in-group versus out-group members. A review of the literature on intergroup attribution biases noted that people generally favor dispositional explanations of an in-group member's positive behavior and situational explanations for an in-group's negative behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-Hewstone_1990_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hewstone_1990-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Alternatively, people are more likely to do the opposite when explaining the behavior of an out-group member (i.e., attribute positive behavior to situational factors and negative behavior to disposition). Essentially, group members' attributions tend to favor the in-group. This finding has implications for understanding other social psychological topics, such as the development and persistence of out-group <a href="/wiki/Stereotype" title="Stereotype">stereotypes</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hewstone_2002_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hewstone_2002-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Attribution biases in intergroup relations are observed as early as childhood. In particular, elementary school students are more likely to make dispositional attributions when their friends perform positive behaviors, but situational attributions when disliked peers perform positive behaviors. Similarly, children are more likely to attribute friends' negative behaviors to situational factors, whereas they attribute disliked peers' negative behaviors to dispositional factors.<sup id="cite_ref-Perry_and_Penner_1990_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Perry_and_Penner_1990-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> These findings provide evidence that attribution biases emerge very early on.

<p>Although certain attribution biases are associated with maladaptive behaviors, such as aggression, some research has also indicated that these biases are flexible and can be altered to produce positive outcomes. Much of this work falls within the domain of improving academic achievement through attributional retraining. For example, one study found that students who were taught to modify their attributions actually performed better on homework assignments and lecture materials.<sup id="cite_ref-Perry_and_Penner_1990_31-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Perry_and_Penner_1990-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> The retraining process specifically targeted students who tended to attribute poor academic performance to external factors. It taught these students that poor performance was often attributable to internal and unstable factors, such as effort and ability. Therefore, the retraining helped students perceive greater control over their own academic success by altering their attributional process.
</p><p>More recent research has extended these findings and examined the value of attributional retraining for helping students adjust to an unfamiliar and competitive setting. In one study, first year college students went through attributional retraining following their first exam in a two-semester course.<sup id="cite_ref-Perry_2010_22-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Perry_2010-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Similar to the previous study, they were taught to make more controllable attributions (e.g., "I can improve my test grade by studying more") and less uncontrollable attributions (e.g., "No matter what I do, I'll fail"). For students who performed low or average on their first exam, attributional retraining resulted in higher in-class test grades and GPA in the second semester. Students who performed well on the first exam were found to have more positive emotions in the second semester following attributional retraining. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for the flexibility and modifiability of attributional biases.

<p>There is inconsistency in the claims made by scientists and researchers that attempt to prove or disprove attribution theories and the concept of attributional biases. The theory was formed as a comprehensive explanation of the way people interpret the basis of behaviors in human interactions; however, there have been studies that indicate cultural differences in the attribution biases between people of Eastern, collectivistic societies and Western, individualistic societies.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> A study done by Thomas Miller<sup id="cite_ref-StangorPrinciples_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-StangorPrinciples-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> shows that when dealing with conflict created by other people, individualistic cultures tend to blame the individual for how people behave (dispositional attributions), whereas collectivist cultures blame the overall situation on how people behave (situational attributions). 
</p><p>These same findings were replicated in a study done by Michael Morris<sup id="cite_ref-StangorPrinciples_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-StangorPrinciples-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> where an American group and a Chinese group were asked their opinions about the killings perpetrated by Gang Lu at the University of Iowa. The American group focused on the killer's own internal problems. The Chinese group focused more on the social conditions surrounding the killing. This reinforces the notion that individualistic and collectivistic cultures tend to focus on different aspects of a situation when making attributions.
</p><p>Additionally, some scientists believe that attributional biases are only exhibited in certain contexts of interaction, where possible outcomes or expectations make the forming of attributions necessary. These criticisms of the attribution model reveal that the theory may not be a general, universal principle.<sup id="cite_ref-Manusov_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Manusov-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The fundamental attribution error refers to a bias in explaining others' behaviors. According to this error, when someone makes attributions about another person's actions, they are likely to overemphasize the role of dispositional factors while minimizing the influence of situational factors.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> For example, if a person sees a coworker bump into someone on his way to a meeting, that person is more likely to explain this behavior in terms of the coworker's carelessness or hastiness rather than considering that he was running late to a meeting.
</p><p>This term was first proposed in the early 1970s by psychologist <a href="/wiki/Lee_Ross" title="Lee Ross">Lee Ross</a> following an experiment he conducted with <a href="/wiki/Edward_E._Jones" title="Edward E.

Participants were then asked to report their attitudes towards the writers under two separate conditions. When participants were informed that the writers voluntarily chose their position towards Castro, participants predictably expressed more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. However, when participants were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss rather than their own free will, participants unpredictably continued to express more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. These results demonstrated that participants did not take situational factors into account when evaluating a third party, thus providing evidence for the fundamental attribution error.

<p>The actor-observer bias (also called actor–observer asymmetry) can be thought of as an extension of the fundamental attribution error. According to the actor-observer bias, in addition to over-valuing dispositional explanations of others' behaviors, people tend to under-value dispositional explanations and over-value situational explanations of their <i>own</i> behavior. For example, a student who studies may explain her behavior by referencing situational factors (e.g., "I have an exam coming up"), whereas others will explain her studying by referencing dispositional factors (e.g., "She's ambitious and hard-working").  This bias was first proposed by <a href="/wiki/Edward_E._Jones" title="Edward E. Jones">Edward E. Jones</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_E._Nisbett" title="Richard E. Nisbett">Richard E. Nisbett</a> in 1971, who explained that "actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor."<sup id="cite_ref-Jones_and_Nisbett_1971_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jones_and_Nisbett_1971-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>There has been some controversy over the theoretical foundation of the actor-observer bias. In a 2006 meta-analysis of all published studies of the bias since 1971, the author found that Jones' and Nisbett's original explanation did not hold.<sup id="cite_ref-Malle_2006_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Malle_2006-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>  Whereas Jones and Nisbett proposed that actors and observers explain behaviors as attributions to either dispositions or situational factors, examining past studies revealed that this assumption may be flawed. Rather, the theoretical reformulation posits that the way people explain behavior depends on whether or not it is intentional, among other things. For more information on this theoretical reformulation, see <a href="/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93observer_asymmetry" title="Actor–observer asymmetry">actor-observer asymmetry</a>, or refer to Malle's meta-analysis in <a href="#Further_reading">#Further reading</a>.
