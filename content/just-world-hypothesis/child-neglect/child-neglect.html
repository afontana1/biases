In "Working Together", the <a href="/wiki/Department_for_Education_and_Skills_(United_Kingdom)" title="Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)">Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)</a><sup id="cite_ref-Df0_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Df0-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> defined neglect in 2006 as:
</p>
<blockquote><p>...the persistent failure to meet a child's basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child's health or development. Neglect may occur during pregnancy as a result of maternal substance abuse. Once a child is born, neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to provide adequate food, clothing and shelter (including exclusion from home or abandonment); protect a child from physical and emotional harm or danger; ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers); or ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child's basic emotional needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Child neglect is commonly defined as a failure by a child's caregiver to meet a child's physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Forms of child neglect include: Allowing the child to witness violence or severe abuse between parents or adult, ignoring, insulting, or threatening the child with violence, not providing the child with a safe environment and adult emotional support, and showing reckless disregard for the child's well-being.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

<p><b>Summary</b>
</p><p>The definition of child neglect is broad. There are no specific guidelines that determine when a child is being neglected; therefore, it is up to state government agencies and professional groups to determine what is considered neglect.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page / location: 13">&#58;&#8202;13&#8202;</span></sup> In general, child neglect is considered the failure of parents or caregivers to meet the needs that are necessary for the mental, physical, and emotional development of a child.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page / location: 262">&#58;&#8202;262&#8202;</span></sup>
</p><p>Child neglect is one of the most common forms of <a href="/wiki/Child_maltreatment" class="mw-redirect" title="Child maltreatment">child maltreatment</a>, and it continues to be a serious problem for many children. Child neglect tremendously affects the <a href="/wiki/Physical_development" class="mw-redirect" title="Physical development">physical development</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mental_development" class="mw-redirect" title="Mental development">mental development</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Infant#Emotional_development" title="Infant">emotional development</a> of a child causing long term consequences, such as poor <a href="/wiki/Academic_achievement" title="Academic achievement">academic achievement</a>, <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" title="Depression (mood)">depression (mood)</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Personality_disorder" title="Personality disorder">personality disorders</a>.

<ul><li>Physical neglect refers to the failure to provide a child with basic necessities of life such as food and clothing.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Medical_neglect" class="mw-redirect" title="Medical neglect">Medical neglect</a> is a failure of caregivers to meet a child's basic health care needs. Example: not brushing teeth on a daily basis, bathing a child and or taking children to doctor visits when needed.</li>
<li>Emotional neglect is failing to provide emotional support such as emotional security and encouragement.</li>
<li>Educational/developmental neglect is the failure to provide a child with experiences for necessary growth and development, such as not sending a child to school or giving them an education.</li>
<li>Depending on the laws and child protective policies in one's area, leaving a young child unsupervised may be considered neglect, especially if doing so places the child in danger.<sup id="cite_ref-nichd.nih.gov_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nichd.nih.gov-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li>Mild neglect is the least likely to be perceived as neglect by the child, but raises the possibility of harm in ways that need intervention by the community. An example might be a parent who does not use a proper car safety seat.</li>
<li>Moderate neglect occurs when some harm to the child has occurred. An example might be a child repeatedly dressed inappropriately for the weather (e.g. shorts in winter.) In cases of moderate harm, governmental agencies might be called in to assist parents.</li>
<li>Severe neglect occurs over time and results in significant harm to the child. An example might be a child with <a href="/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> being denied treatment.</li></ul>

<p>Children may be left at home alone, which can result in negative consequences.

<p>At the intra-personal level, the discussion around neglectful parents' characteristics often focuses on mothers, reflecting traditional notions of women as primary caregivers for children.<sup id="cite_ref-TT0_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TT0-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Scou0_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Scou0-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> "Neglectful attributes" have included an inability to plan, lack of confidence about the future, difficulty with managing money, emotional immaturity, lack of knowledge of children's needs, a large number of children, being a teenage mother, high levels of stress and poor socioeconomic circumstances.<sup id="cite_ref-Coo0_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Coo0-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gio0_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gio0-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-May0_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-May0-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Pol0_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pol0-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Tom0_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Tom0-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> Mental health problems, particularly depression, have been linked with a parent's inability to meet a child's needs.<sup id="cite_ref-Min1_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Min1-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Likewise, substance misuse is believed to play a crucial role in undermining a parent's ability to cope with parental responsibilities. Recent empirical works have also pointed to parental burnout (i.e., chronic lack of parenting resources) as an especially potent mechanism in driving neglectful behavior toward children.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> While the literature largely focuses on mothers, the role of fathers in neglect, as well as the impact of their absence, remains largely unexplored. There is still little known about whether mothers and fathers neglect differently and how this affects children. Similarly, not much is known about whether girls and boys experience neglect differently.

<p>At the inter-personal/family level, a significant number of neglectful families are headed by a lone mother or have a transient male.<sup id="cite_ref-Ste0_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ste0-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> Unstable and abusive relationships have also been mentioned as increasing the risk of child neglect.

<p>Effects of child neglect can differ depending on the individual and how much treatment is provided, but generally speaking child neglect that occurs in the first two years of a child's life may be more of an important precursor of childhood aggression compared to later neglect, which may not have as strong a correlation. Children who suffer from neglect most often also have <a href="/wiki/Attachment_theory" title="Attachment theory">attachment</a> difficulties, cognitive deficits, emotional/behavioral problems, and physical consequences as a result of neglect. Early neglect has the potential to modify the body's stress response, specifically cortisol levels (stress hormones) which can cause abnormalities and alter the body's overall health. Research has shown that there is a relationship between neglect and disturbed patterns of infant-caretaker attachment. If parents lack sensitivity to their baby's needs, the baby may develop <a href="/wiki/Attachment_theory#Attachment_patterns" title="Attachment theory">insecure-anxious attachment</a>. The neglectful behavior the child experiences will contribute to their attachment difficulties and formation of relationships in the future, or lack thereof. In addition to biological and social effects, neglect affects intellectual ability and cognitive/academic deficits. Also, children who suffer from child neglect may also suffer from anxiety or impulse-control disorders. Another result of child neglect is what people call "<a href="/wiki/Failure_to_thrive" title="Failure to thrive">failure to thrive</a>". Infants who have deficits in growth and abnormal behaviors such as withdrawal, apathy and excessive sleep are failing to thrive, rather than developing to become "healthy" individuals (Barnett et al., p 86).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="A complete citation is needed.

<p>In terms of who is reported for neglectful behavior, it is most often women. The higher proportion of females reported for neglect may reflect the social attitude that mothers are responsible for meeting the needs of their children. In recent years, latent issues for child development and for the culture and political economy that are associated with paternal neglect have received more attention, however.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> Neglecting parents interact less with their children, engage in less verbal instruction and play behavior, show less affection and are involved in more negative interactions with their children, for example verbal aggression. Often parents who neglect their children are single parents or disabled mothers who already have to care for themselves, and therefore the child is an additional stress. This additional stress is often neglected. Family size can contribute to child neglect. If a family has several children, they may not be able to give all the children all the basic necessities needed to survive and thrive. Unfortunately, if the family cannot provide for all their children, children can suffer neglect. Family history can play a role in parents’ neglectful behavior. If parents were neglected as children meaning they learned neglectful behavior from their own parents, they often internalize and believe those behaviors to be the "norm", which results in neglecting their own children (Barnett et al., p.&#160;92).<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> In one study done in 2011, results showed that one in four mothers were neglectful, and neglect was four times as likely with a maternal history of physical abuse in childhood than with no history of maltreatment.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> Neglect is by far the most common type of child abuse reported in the U.S., and in 2016, it accounted for nearly 65 percent of child abuse cases.

<p>Assessing and identifying neglect pose a number of challenges for practitioners.
</p><p>Selecting the right method to identify neglect can be helped by having a clear conceptualization of neglect. Neglect is a process whereby a child experiences developmental delay owing to the fact of not having received sufficient levels of any combination of care, stimulation or nutrition, what collectively can be referred to as nurturance. Given that neglect is a dynamic between the child's development and levels of nurturance, the question in identifying neglect, becomes one of where does one start, with the child's development or with the levels of nurturance?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Development_focused_methods">Development focused methods</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Child_neglect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Development focused methods">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Some professionals identify neglect by measuring the developmental levels of a child, for if those developmental levels are normal, one can, by definition, conclude that a child is not being neglected. Areas of development that could be measured include weight, height, stamina, social and emotional responses, speech and motor development. All these features go up to make a medical assessment of whether a child is thriving, so that a professional looking to start an assessment of neglect, might reasonably start with information collected by a doctor. Infants are often weighed and measured when seen by their physicians for <a href="/w/index.php?title=Well-baby_visit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Well-baby visit (page does not exist)">well-baby check-ups</a>. The physician initiates a more complete evaluation when the infant's development and functioning are found to be delayed. What this suggests is that social work staff could consult medical notes to establish if the baby or child is failing to thrive, as a first step in a pathway towards identifying neglect. If developmental levels are subnormal, then the identification of neglect requires the professional establish if those subnormal levels of development can be put down to the level of nurturance experienced by the child. One needs to discount that the developmental delay was caused by some genetic condition or disease.

<p>Another way of beginning the process of identifying neglect is to identify if the child in question is experiencing a level of nurturance lower than that considered necessary to support normal development.<sup id="cite_ref-Daniel,_B._2011_57-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Daniel,_B._2011-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> In part, this requires a knowledge of the level of nurturance required by the child to sustain normal development, which might be particular to his or her age, gender and other factors.<sup id="cite_ref-Daniel,_B._2011_57-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Daniel,_B._2011-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> However, quite how one ascertains what a particular child needs, without referring back to their level of development, is not something theory and policy on neglect is clear about. Furthermore, ascertaining whether a child is getting the requisite level of nurturance needs to take into account not just the intensity of the nurturance, but also, given that the intensity of certain forms of nurturance can carry across time, the duration and frequency of the nurturance. It is OK for a child to experience varying and low levels of certain types of nurturance across a day and from time to time, however, it is not OK if the levels of nurturance never cross thresholds of intensity, duration and frequency. For this reason, professionals are minded to keep detailed histories of care provision, which demonstrate the duration to which the child is exposed to periods of subnormal exposure to care, stimulation and nutrition.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">&#91;59&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">&#91;60&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Professionals should focus on the levels of nurturance provided by the carers of the child, where neglect is understood as an issue of the parents' behaviour.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup> Some authors feel that establishing the failure of parents and caregivers to provide care would be sufficient to conclude that neglect was occurring.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> Action for Children<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> state that, "A child experiences neglect when the adults who look after them fail to meet their needs" clearly defining neglect as a matter of parental performance. This raises the question about what level of nurturance, a carer or parent needs to fall under, to provoke developmental delay, and how one goes about measuring that accurately.
</p><p>The method, which focuses on the stimulation provided by the carer, can be subject to critique. Neglect is about the child's development being adversely affected by the levels of nurturance, but the carers' provision of nurturance is not always a good indicator of the level of nurturance received by the child. Neglect may be occurring at school, outside of parental care. The child may be receiving nurturance from siblings or through a boarding school education, which compensates for the lack of nurturance provided by the parents.

<p>Neglect is a process whereby children experience developmental delay owing to experiencing insufficient levels of nurturance. It has been argued that in principle, this means that when starting an assessment of neglect by identifying developmental delay one needs to then check the levels of nurturance received by the child. Certainly, where guidance on identifying neglect does urge for practitioners to measure developmental levels, some guidance urges practitioners to focus on how developmental levels can be attributed to parental behaviour.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> However the narrow focus on parental behaviour can be criticised for unnecessarily ruling out the possible impact of institutionalised neglect, e.g. neglect at school.
</p><p>If one starts by concluding that the levels of nurturance received by the child are insufficient, one then needs to consider the developmental levels achieved by the child.
</p><p>Further challenges arise however. Even when one has established developmental delay and exposure to low levels of nurturance, one needs to rule out the possibility that the link between the two is coincidental. The developmental delay may be caused by a genetic disorder, disease or physical, sexual or <a href="/wiki/Emotional_abuse" class="mw-redirect" title="Emotional abuse">emotional abuse</a>. Of course the developmental delay may be caused by a mixture of underexposure to nurturance, abuse, genetics and disease.

<p>Several interventions aimed at families where child neglect is occurring, have been subject to an impact study.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Video_interaction_guidance_2">Video interaction guidance</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Child_neglect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26" title="Edit section: Video interaction guidance">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> An evaluation of the project demonstrated that VIG produced a significant change in the emotional and behavioural difficulties of the population of children who received the service, and improvement in reported level of parenting and reported parental relationship with their children in the population of parents whose children received the service.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> The data excludes to parents who failed to complete the programme, parents who completed the programme but decided not to complete evaluation measures, and on some measures parents who completed measures but whose feedback was adjudged to have been positively biased.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The SafeCare programme has been provided to families in the United Kingdom where a professional has judged there is a risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect. Outcome data shows that on average families who participated in the evaluation of the programme improved parenting skills and reduced neglectful behaviours. Furthermore, all referrers reported see positive changes in the families they referred, particularly in home safety, parent child interaction and health. However, in the absence of a comparison group it was not possible to attribute the changes to SafeCare.<sup id="cite_ref-nspcc.org.uk2_72-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nspcc.org.uk2-72">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Triple P has also been provided to families in the United Kingdom where neglect is a concern. The findings from this service showed that, on average the children who participated in the evaluation experienced improved emotional and behavioural outcomes. However this positive change could not be attributed to Triple P because a control group had not been established.<sup id="cite_ref-nspcc.org.uk_52-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nspcc.org.uk-52">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Qualitative research studies have also illuminated some of the ways in which programs can help individual parents.

<p>A common finding across evaluations of programmes designed to help families where neglect is a concern is that the principal factor which influences parents' engagement and perception is the quality of the relationship that they are able to build up with the practitioner delivering the programme.<sup id="cite_ref-nspcc.org.uk_52-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nspcc.org.uk-52">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_74-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-74">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> Key factors in helping practitioners engage parents into the intervention include:
</p>
<ul><li>Establishing a sense that the practitioner will support the family beyond what is necessary to complete the intervention.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup></li>

<li>Ensuring that fun forms a part of the interaction.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Making family members feel cared for through the provision of clothes, food and gifts.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_71-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup></li>

<p>In the case of Video Interaction Guidance, when parents were asked about their experience of the intervention, parents invariably referred to the care and support provided by the practitioner.
