<p>Having recently moved to the U.S. from Ireland, Prince was taunted and bullied for several weeks by at least two groups of students at <a href="/wiki/South_Hadley_High_School" title="South Hadley High School">South Hadley High School</a>, following disputes with two girls in late December 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-Cullen_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cullen-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Her aunt reportedly warned school officials in August 2009, prior to Prince's enrollment at the school, to watch after Prince, as she was "susceptible" to problems including peer pressure and bullying. Investigations later found that Prince was in fact one of four girls bullying a student in Ireland in a dispute over a relationship with a boy. After the victim of that bullying was moved to another school by her parents, Prince wrote a letter of apology which was praised by the victim's mother, who blamed the bullying on peer pressure and the lack of action by the school authorities.<sup id="cite_ref-Slate1_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Slate1-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-irishcentral.com_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-irishcentral.com-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>

It was after this final incident that Prince died by suicide by hanging herself in the stairwell leading to the second floor of the family apartment.

<p>On March 29, 2010, Northwestern District Attorney <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Scheibel" title="Elizabeth Scheibel">Elizabeth Scheibel</a> announced at a press conference<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> that two male and four female teenagers from South Hadley High School were indicted as adults on felony charges by a Hampshire County grand jury. Charges ranged from <a href="/wiki/Statutory_rape" title="Statutory rape">statutory rape</a> for two male teenagers, to violation of civil rights, criminal harassment, disturbance of a school assembly, and stalking. One of the males charged with statutory rape was not involved in the bullying. Additional delinquency complaints were also filed against three of the four females as they were minors at the time of the incident. One minor was also charged with assault with a deadly weapon for throwing an empty can at Phoebe Prince. A separate delinquency complaint was filed against another of the three female minors for assault and battery against another girl at South Hadley High School (a girl who was attacked at school after appearing in a TV news report describing the bullying that took place at South Hadley High School).<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> At least four of these six students reportedly were still attending South Hadley High School when the charges were announced.<sup id="cite_ref-cbs3springfield1_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cbs3springfield1-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-google_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-google-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-boston1_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-boston1-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>

The investigation has revealed that certain faculty, staff and administrators of the high school also were alerted to the harassment of Phoebe Prince before her death. Prior to Phoebe's death, her mother spoke with at least two school staff members about the harassment Phoebe had reported to her.
</p><p>Some bystanders, including at least four students and two faculty members, intervened while the harassment was occurring or reported it to administrators. A lack of understanding of harassment associated with teen dating relationships seems to have been prevalent at South Hadley High School. That, in turn, brought an inconsistent interpretation in enforcement in the school's code of conduct when incidents were observed and reported.
</p><p>
In reviewing this investigation, we've considered whether or not the actions or omissions to act by faculty, staff and administrators of the South Hadley public schools individually, or collectively, amounted to criminal behavior. In our opinion, it did not. Nevertheless, the actions or inactions of some adults at the school are troublesome.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Scheibel indicated that the investigation was ongoing and that charges against additional South Hadley students were likely. She urged schools to adopt anti-bullying awareness and training programs for staff and students and expressed the wishes of the Prince family to refrain from vigilantism and to seek justice only through the criminal justice system.<sup id="cite_ref-boston1_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-boston1-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> "Now is not the time for retributions or reprisals," Scheibel said.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>
