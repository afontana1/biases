<p>The suicide of <b>Tyrone Unsworth</b> (16 August 2003 – 22 November 2016) occurred on 22 November 2016, in <a href="/wiki/Brisbane" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>.

</p><p>Unsworth's suicide was particularly controversial because it took place in the context of a number of vigorous debates in Australia about <a href="/wiki/LGBTI" class="mw-redirect" title="LGBTI">LGBTI</a> issues, notably same-sex marriage and LGBTI-specific anti-bullying programs in schools. Throughout 2016, there had been significant controversy over one such program: the <a href="/wiki/Safe_Schools_Coalition_Australia" title="Safe Schools Coalition Australia">Safe Schools Coalition Australia</a>, of which the federal government had curtailed the operation. Unsworth's death renewed criticism of that decision, and was cited as evidence that the program was needed.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>There are ongoing criminal proceedings regarding some of the bullying Unsworth faced from his school peers.<sup id="cite_ref-:7_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:7-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In February 2016, the Safe Schools Coalition Australia, an initiative designed to combat anti-LGBTI prejudice in schools, became the center of significant political and social debate. It was criticized by conservatives prominent in both media and politics, who contended that the program was more about enforcing a radical view of sexuality and gender on school children than its stated goals.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> It was also criticized by socially conservative activists such as the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Christian_Lobby" title="Australian Christian Lobby">Australian Christian Lobby</a>, who objected to its affirmation of homosexuality and its opposition to <a href="/wiki/Homophobia" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>On 23 February, Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" title="Malcolm Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a> announced that the program would be reviewed,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> a move heavily criticized by LGBTI advocates and Opposition Leader <a href="/wiki/Bill_Shorten" title="Bill Shorten">Bill Shorten</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> On 11 March the review was given to the government,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> and it was made public on 16 March. The review largely vindicated the program, angering conservative MPs.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> 43 Coalition MPs signed a petition calling for the program to be suspended.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> On 18 March the federal government announced that the program would be significantly curtailed.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Its response went beyond that recommended by the review, which led to further criticism by LGBTI advocates.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposed_plebiscite_on_same-sex_marriage">Proposed plebiscite on same-sex marriage</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Suicide_of_Tyrone_Unsworth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Proposed plebiscite on same-sex marriage">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>On 11 August 2015, after a party room meeting of both the Liberal and National parties, the Coalition government decided that while they would continue to vote as a block against same-sex marriage for the term of Parliament of the time, it would hold a plebiscite on same-sex marriage after the next election.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The proposal was almost unanimously rejected by the <a href="/wiki/LGBT_in_Australia" title="LGBT in Australia">LGBTI community in Australia</a>; one survey returned 85% opposition to a plebiscite among the LGBTI community.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Opinion polls at the time showed a strong majority of Australians in favour of the proposal; however, some LGBTI advocates have contended that this support was not due to in-principle support for a plebiscite, but rather the loss of faith in the Parliament to legislate, and a belief that a plebiscite was necessary to legalise same-sex marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After taking over the leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a> and Prime Ministership in September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull pledged to continue the government's support for a plebiscite.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> An attempt at a conscience vote on same-sex marriage was blocked by the government on 2 March 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>One argument against the plebiscite offered by its opponents is that it would have a negative impact on the mental health of LGBTI people. On 22 October 2015, during Parliament's Question Time, Shorten asked Turnbull about his support for the plebiscite, citing a submission from Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria opposing the plebiscite on mental health grounds. Turnbull responded that the debate would be respectful.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The Coalition campaigned on the plebiscite at the 2016 election, pledging to hold it if re-elected. Labor pledged a parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage if it was elected, with Shorten citing the <a href="/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting" title="Orlando nightclub shooting">Orlando nightclub shooting</a> as highlighting the possible dangers of a plebiscite.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> His comment was criticized by opponents of same-sex marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The Coalition was re-elected at the 2 July election with a one-seat majority,<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> and continued planning for the plebiscite. However, in July 2016, opinion polls began to show decreasing support for the proposal. One poll found initial support for a plebiscite to be 48%, but that when voters were aware that Coalition MPs would not be required to vote for same-sex marriage if it was passed, support dropped to 35%, and when voters were aware that it would cost $160 million, support fell to 25%.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>
On 12 September 2016, Shorten spoke in Parliament against a plebiscite. He again invoked mental health, but also suicide, commenting:<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>Every piece of expert advice tells us young Australians who are gay are more likely to contemplate suicide and more likely to take their own lives. The idea of young people, perhaps yet to come out, seeing the legitimacy of their identity debated on the national stage. That is not an ideal inflicted on any citizen when we have a better path. Let me be as blunt as possible: a 'no' campaign would be an emotional torment for gay teenagers, and if one child commits suicide over the plebiscite, then that is one too many.</p></blockquote><p>This comment was strongly criticised by conservative commentators, who labelled it "emotional blackmail".<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> However, on 4 October 2016, the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> reported that mental health service Lifeline had added "2016 Marriage Equality Plebiscite" to a list of reasons that people seek its services, in anticipation of increased demand of its services should the plebiscite go ahead.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The bill for the plebiscite was introduced to the Parliament on 14 September 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> On 11 October the Labor caucus unanimously decided to bind against it. With Labor's numbers against it in the Senate, passage of the plebiscite bill was widely considered impossible.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> It passed the House on 20 October,<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> but was voted down by the Senate on 7 November.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> (However, after Unsworth's death, a popular vote on same-sex marriage did take place in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Marriage_Law_Postal_Survey" title="Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey">Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey</a>.)
</p><p>LGBTI advocates have repeatedly criticised the debate about marriage equality in Australia as vitriolic,<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> and have argued that homophobia generated by the debate and the plebiscite contributed to Unsworth's suicide. Some have further argued that his suicide vindicates criticism of the plebiscite on the grounds it would make LGBTI suicides more likely.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>

<p>On 27 October 2016, Unsworth was the victim of a violent assault, in which he was struck in the jaw with a fence pole.
