<p>Cohen, Stotland and Wolfe (1955),<sup id="cite_ref-Cohen1955_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cohen1955-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation, identified a "<i>need for cognition</i>" which they defined as "the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully", the "need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways", and "need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world" (p.&#160;291). They argued that, if this "need" were frustrated, it would generate "feelings of tension and deprivation" that would instigate "active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding" (p.&#160;291), though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary (p.&#160;291). Cohen argued that even in structured situations, people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity.

Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is, however, closer to tolerance of ambiguity, need for structure, or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition. For instance, studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get "meaning" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information.<sup id="cite_ref-Cacioppo1996_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cacioppo1996-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>Cacioppo and Petty (1982) created their own 34-item scale to measure the need for cognition.

<p>People high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments (i.e., via the <a href="/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model#Central_route" title="Elaboration likelihood model">central route to persuasion</a>), whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on <a href="/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model#Peripheral_route" title="Elaboration likelihood model">peripheral cues</a>, such as how attractive or credible a speaker is.

</p><p>Psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests, where research participants answered a series of statements such as "I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them.

<p>NFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called <a href="/wiki/Cognitive-experiential_self-theory" title="Cognitive-experiential self-theory">cognitive-experiential self-theory</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cacioppo2000_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cacioppo2000-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems, a rational system and an experiential system. The rational system is thought to be logical, verbal and relatively unemotional. The experiential system is thought to be intuitive, based on images and highly reliant on emotion. A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system, whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition.
</p><p>Research shows that the two systems are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other. That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments. In fact, individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways. When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions, intuitions, and images in an automatic way. On the other hand, those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments, and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions, intuitions, and images. Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more "rational" than those low in this trait, if their faith in intuition is also high. Rather, their "irrational" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition.<sup id="cite_ref-Cacioppo2000_16-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cacioppo2000-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<p>NFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision. Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment. People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts, that is, heuristic biases. People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought.<sup id="cite_ref-Cacioppo2000_16-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cacioppo2000-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<p>High need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., <i>chair</i> if the original list contained <i>table</i> and <i>legs</i>). People high in NFC are more likely to show <a href="/wiki/False_memory" title="False memory">false memory</a> for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related (but non-studied) items.<sup id="cite_ref-Cacioppo2000_16-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cacioppo2000-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<li>It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although it is also possible that higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking.</li>
<li>NFC may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality.</li>
<li>Regarding absorption, people high in NFC may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks.</li>
<li>Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.<sup id="cite_ref-osberg_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-osberg-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup></li>
