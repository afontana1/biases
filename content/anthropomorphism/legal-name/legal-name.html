<p>A <b>legal name</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Name" title="Name">name</a> that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of <a href="/wiki/Civil_registry" class="mw-redirect" title="Civil registry">registration of the birth</a> and which then appears on a <a href="/wiki/Birth_certificate" title="Birth certificate">birth certificate</a> (see <i><a href="/wiki/Birth_name" title="Birth name">birth name</a></i>), but may change subsequently. Most <a href="/wiki/Jurisdiction" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdictions</a> require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a <a href="/wiki/Name_change" title="Name change">name change</a> to be recorded at <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a>. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes their first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations).
</p><p>A person's legal name typically is the same as their <a href="/wiki/Personal_name" title="Personal name">personal name</a>, comprising a <a href="/wiki/Given_name" title="Given name">given name</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Family_name" class="mw-redirect" title="Family name">family name</a>. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by-country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See <i><a href="/wiki/Married_name" class="mw-redirect" title="Married name">married name</a></i>.)
</p><p>Most countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of "undesirable" names. In 1991, a <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as <a href="/wiki/Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116" class="mw-redirect" title="Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116">Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and then as "A".

<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Civil_Code_of_Quebec" title="Civil Code of Quebec">Civil Code of Quebec</a></i> states that "Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  However, a woman married before this law was passed in April 2, 1981 retains her right to use her husband's name in the execrcise of her civil rights. <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>Unfortuantely, this right is not respected for older women, married before 1981.

Likewise proofs of vaccination are issued to them in their birthname, making it unusable when their proof of vaccination must conform with the name in their government-issued passport. This dilemma also applies to younger women who are vaccinated in Quebec, but whose legal ID is their married name, due to marriage elsewhere.

<p>In Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly <a href="/wiki/Married_name#Germany" class="mw-redirect" title="Married name">adopting the partner's name</a> upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous.
</p><p>The information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites).
