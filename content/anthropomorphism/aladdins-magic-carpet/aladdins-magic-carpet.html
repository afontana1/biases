<p>Gazeem (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Adler" title="Charlie Adler">Charlie Adler</a>) is Jafar's criminal minion, seen just at the beginning of <i>Aladdin</i>, used by his master to steal the other half of the scarab amulet used to summon the Cave of Wonders. Although his competence is called sufficiently into question for Iago to refer to him as a "bozo" and he does provide some mild comic relief, he admits to Jafar that he "slit a few throats" in order to get his prize.  As soon as his half of the scarab is joined together with Jafar's, it comes to life and flies off to the cave's location and they follow its magical trail on horseback. When the cave forms, Jafar tells Gazeem to bring him the lamp, and that while he can have the rest of the treasure inside, the lamp is his (having previously told the thief ambiguously "You'll get what's coming to you."). When he attempts to enter, the cave demands to know who woke it up, and Gazeem introduces himself. The cave warns him that only one man, the Diamond in the Rough, whom the cave does not identify, may enter. Ordered to proceed by Jafar, Gazeem goes a little way into the cave and breathes a sigh of relief, when suddenly the cave roars furiously and collapses. Gazeem frantically tries to escape, but although he is still very close to the entrance, the entire cave roof comes crashing down with amazing speed and reduces to sand. Gazeem remains trapped inside, presumably forever, much to Jafar's shock and anger. Having lost his accomplice, Jafar realizes that Gazeem was not the Diamond in the Rough and sets out to find this particular man who can enter the cave. When Aladdin and Abu enter the cave later on, Gazeem is nowhere to be seen, so he is presumed to have been crushed to death when the cave collapsed.  
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Disney%27s_Aladdin_(Virgin_Games_video_game)" title="Disney&#39;s Aladdin (Virgin Games video game)"><i>Aladdin</i> video game</a>, Gazeem is the first <a href="/wiki/Boss_(video_gaming)" class="mw-redirect" title="Boss (video gaming)">boss</a> (or perhaps mini-boss) that the player meets, where his defeat results in his dropping half of the scarab amulet necessary to allow Aladdin to proceed to the Cave of Wonders at a subsequent level.

<p>Abis Mal's Thugs are the many unnamed followers of Abis Mal. They first appear in <i>The Return of Jafar</i> where they return from a night of looting, only to have their treasure stolen by Aladdin and Abu who return the stolen jewels and riches to their victims. They later reappear with their boss as they attack Aladdin, Abu, and Iago at the marketplace. After Iago does a trick that causes Abis Mal to crash into his men, the criminals end up crashing into an egg vendor's cart and get chased off by the Royal Guards. They fall back to a well where the robbers attempt to kill their incompetent leader, only to run off when Abis Mal rubs the lamp that Jafar's genie form is in.
</p><p>Abis Mal's minions reappear in the TV series where, though still under the lead of Abis Mal, they are shown to be involved in a limited number of his schemes. The most prominent instance is in the episode "Air Feather Friends" where they use the feathers of a baby <a href="/wiki/Roc_(mythology)" title="Roc (mythology)">roc</a> to pose as wind demons in order to rob Agrabah. Their plot was thwarted by Aladdin, Genie, and the mother roc. Other episodes where Abis Mal is shown being aided by his henchmen (aside from Haroud Hazi Bin) are "Forget Me Lots", "Lost and Founded", and "Smolder and Wiser". Occasions where they appear without their leader are typically at the Skull and Dagger, the headquarters of Agrabah's guild for thieves and criminals, often referred to by Abis Mal himself as a "den of thieves".
</p><p>In <i>Aladdin and the King of Thieves</i>, some of the Forty Thieves resemble many of those in Abis Mal's gang, though it's unclear if these are the same characters.

<p>Amin Damoola (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Bennett" title="Jeff Bennett">Jeff Bennett</a>) is a clumsy, cowardly, and incompetent thief, who appears in four episodes. Amin always finds a way to cause trouble for Aladdin (and usually ends up in trouble himself). Some of these ways are stealing a magical glove, creating a large green dragon, and getting a bunch of magical tools from <a href="/wiki/Mozenrath" class="mw-redirect" title="Mozenrath">Mozenrath</a>. In his last episode he was working for Mozenrath who realized too late a mistake in hiring Damoola ("This is what I get for subcontracting!"); when Damoola is down to of two his last two magical tricks, Mozenrath gives him an simple choice: succeed in stealing the Sultan and become the greatest thief in Agrabah, or face Mozenrath's anger and regret the day he was born. True to form Damoola is defeated by Aladdin and Genie; an enraged Mozenrath did not take his failure too well, and it is likely that he possibly turned him into a mamluk [a zombie soldier] or something even worse as punishment.

<p>Arbutus (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Ron_Perlman" title="Ron Perlman">Ron Perlman</a>) is a sorcerer who only appeared in the episode "Garden of Evil". He has the power to make vegetation and flora immediately grow and manipulate them to his will. His name comes from the genus of trees called <a href="/wiki/Arbutus" title="Arbutus">Arbutus</a>. While not evil in nature, he has more in common with plants than with humans and sees most humans as enemies for killing his beautiful works of art for their crass purposes (wood for heat and smoke which blocks the sun, flowers to die slowly in vases, etc.). He sees himself as an artist and makes most plants grow with the intention of creating something beautiful, even during battle. He is especially appreciative of 'living beauty' and while he prefers plants he is aware that other organisms such as birds and even humans can enhance his artwork.
</p><p>Many years ago, a younger Sultan came to the garden of Arbutus because he had heard that the most beautiful flowers grew there, to pick a flower for his bride. Arbutus did not attempt to harm the Sultan upon his entry, as he admired the beauty of the garden. But the sorcerer was enraged when the Sultan plucked a flower, effectively killing it. In order to allow the Sultan to go free he demanded that in 20 years time he be given the Sultan's most precious treasure. Desperate to escape and not fully grasping Arbutus' meaning, the Sultan quickly agreed and hurried away. Twenty years later, Arbutus came to Agrabah for the Sultan's most precious treasure — Jasmine. At no point in the episode does he make any attempt to physically harm Jasmine despite holding her captive, and even befriends her briefly due to her gentle words, her appreciation of his artwork, and the fact that she is named after a flower.
</p><p>Arbutus' only weakness is the rose on his <a href="/wiki/Lapel" title="Lapel">lapel</a>. Once it is cut off, he withers and dies, as does the beautiful garden which he created. Princess Jasmine explains to Aladdin that Arbutus is not evil, only "different", and she, Aladdin, the Sultan and the Genie replant the flower, which perks up, and a deep inhalation is heard, suggesting that he will return to life in time.
</p><p>Arbutus bears an uncanny resemblance to Jafar.

He is the third major arch enemy that Aladdin faces (after Abis Mal and Mechanicles). Mozenrath is just as evil as Jafar, with Iago once referring to him as "Jafar Junior", comparing the two sorcerers' ambition and cruelty. In the episode "Black Sand", Mozenrath was seen in Jafar's lab and Iago asked him if he knew Jafar. Despite their similarities, there is no connection between Jafar and Mozenrath.
</p><p>Due to the price of the gauntlet's power, Mozenrath's right arm has become completely skeletal, and it has implied that the gauntlet will eventually kill him.  He is the ruler of the Land of the Black Sand, this kingdom has naturally black sand, the sun is always blocked by clouds, and the only residents are himself, his flying eel sidekick Xerxes, and an army of undead Mamluks who blindly serve him. He is quite open and accepting about his own cruelty, and he prides himself on his ruthlessness. He took control of the Land of the Black Sand from its former ruler, the sorcerer Destane. According to Iago, Destane was "a real hard case. Even Jafar steered clear of him." Mozenrath explained that Destane was like a father to him until he "stole his power and his throne", and even "stole his humanity", turning him into one of his Mamluks.
</p><p>Mozenrath's main goal is to become the world's most powerful wizard and to rule the other six kingdoms of the Seven Deserts [Agrabah; MesmerIA; Isle of Galifem; Getzistan; Quirkistan;Shirabad]. While he and his undead Mamluk soldiers have secure control over the Land of the Black Sand, they are not powerful enough to conquer the other kingdoms that Mozenrath seeks to rule. Because of this, his plots and schemes usually involve obtaining more magic and becoming more powerful. Before he can accomplish his goal of total despotic rule he must overcome the only two obstecules to his plan [Aladdin and Genie]. Through the course of the series he tried to kill Aladdin and his friends multiple times. He also attempted to capture the Genie several times so that he could tap his magical energies and use them for his own purposes.
</p><p>Despite Mozenrath's determined and ruthless attitude, he seems to enjoy bantering and tormenting Aladdin and his friends. At his first meeting with Aladdin, he is polite and even friendly until he shows his lack of compassion for others. This is when Aladdin makes it clear he does not wish to work with Mozenrath. In subsequent appearances, Mozenrath often loses interest in his plans as soon as they are defeated and does not attempt to kill Aladdin after their battles have ended. His overall demeanor is one of boredom and impatience. After being defeated by Aladdin multiple times in the course of the series, Mozenrath's final appearance his magical gauntlet has physically exhausted Mozenrath to the extent that he tries and fails to take over Aladdin's mind and body and ends with him losing his gauntlet and being sent away in a giant balloon with his sidekick Xerxes by the Genie ("Two to Tangle")..
</p><p>Mozenrath was the main antagonist in nine episodes of the series. He had a cameo as one of three of guest villains [with Abis Mal and Mechanicles]in a show-and-tell of three of Aladdins most evil foes by the Genie. Originally, in the first storyline idea for <i>Aladdin and the King of Thieves</i>, Mozenrath was included in the film as the main villain, and the plot of the film was going to reveal that he and Aladdin were brothers [I.e. <a href="/wiki/Evil_twin" title="Evil twin">evil twin</a>). However (according to one of the writers of the film), everyone felt they should steer away from the television show, and they were also unable to get in contact with Jonathan Brandis (Mozenrath's voice actor), which prompted them to change the storyline and move onto another one of Aladdin's relatives: his father.

<p>Phasir (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Ed_Gilbert" title="Ed Gilbert">Ed Gilbert</a>) appears frequently through the series. His first appearance is in the episode "Do the Rat Thing", but he is not named or given any background until the episode "The Prophet Motive", where he is identified as Phasir, an old seer and powerful wizard who turned his evil giant brother Fashoom into stone many centuries ago. The end of that episode also reveals that he actually has a single eye like a cyclops, but he wears bands over his one eye which makes him appear to be just blind (it is never made clear whether he actually is blind or merely pretends to be in order to hide his eye). Later episodes, such as "Eye of the Beholder" and "While the City Snoozes" hint that Phasir has had dealings with Mirage in the past and they may have once been lovers (he states to himself that love will one day lead Mirage back to him).

<p>Cassim (voiced by <a href="/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies" title="John Rhys-Davies">John Rhys-Davies</a>, singing voice provided by Merwin Foard) is Aladdin's long-lost widowed father.
</p><p>Long before the events of the first film, he left his wife and newborn son in Agrabah in order to find the legendary Hand of Midas so that he could provide a better life for the poverty-stricken family, not wanting to be looked down upon. Some time later, he fell in with the Forty Thieves, eventually becoming their leader (the "King of Thieves"), and incorporated a new law: never hurt the innocent. One of his goals is to find the Oracle that would guide him to the Hand. Eventually, Cassim's travels brought him back to Agrabah, having learned that the Oracle was inside the Sultan's royal treasure room, ironically on his own son's wedding day to Princess Jasmine.
</p><p>Having his men create a distraction, Cassim infiltrates the treasure room and finds the Oracle, but is intercepted by Aladdin and the two fight, unaware that they are father and son, and Cassim is forced to retreat empty-handed. After the incident at the wedding, Aladdin uses the Oracle to learn that his father is alive and finds him with the Forty Thieves, only learning there and then that he is their leader. He and Cassim finally meet when Sa'luk tries to mutiny and kill Cassim for their unsuccessful raid on the palace. Cassim avoids having Aladdin killed by having him fight Sa'luk. After Aladdin defeats Sa'luk by kicking him off a cliff, Cassim states that the Code of the 40 Thieves is clear on this point and states that he is in.
</p><p>When he tells Aladdin of the Hand of Midas and joins him in Agrabah, Aladdin had to talk Genie down when Aladdin introduced him. Cassim and Iago found where the Oracle is only for them to be ambushed by Razoul and the Guards. When the Sultan learned that Cassim is the King of Thieves, he had no choice but to have Cassim and Iago locked in the dungeon with a life sentence. With help from Aladdin and Genie, Cassim and Iago got out and left with the Oracle. Returning to Mount Sesame, he finds that Sa'luk had turned 7 of the 40 Thieves that evaded capture against him. Sa'luk then has Cassim call the Oracle to guide them to the Hand of Midas. The Oracle guides them to the Vanishing Isle (a castle fortress attached on the back of a giant turtle). Thanks to Iago getting away, Aladdin, Genie, and Carpet head there to rescue Cassim. Cassim and Aladdin fight Sa'luk over the Hand of Midas which ends with Sa'luk accidentally turned to gold. Now realizing that his son is the treasure of his life, Cassim discards the Hand of Midas into the sea and reconciles with Aladdin, finally freed from his greed. Cassim also showed up to indirectly congratulate him after watching his and Jasmine's wedding from the shadows, since he is still a wanted man. He leaves too soon to travel the world for some time along with Iago, who thinks he's finally found a great companion.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Disney_Princess_Enchanted_Tales:_Follow_Your_Dreams" title="Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams">Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams</a></i> it is not confirmed, but since Iago has returned to Agrabah as his travels with Cassim at the end, even Aladdin's father is certainly returned. However, just like Aladdin and Genie, he doesn't appear since the main focus is about Jasmine.
</p><p>While not appearing in the <a href="/wiki/Aladdin_(2019_film)" title="Aladdin (2019 film)">live-action remake</a> of the original film, Aladdin's father is mentioned. While Aladdin explicitly states to Jasmine that his mother is dead, he responds that he "lost both his parents" when he was very little when she asks about his father, leaving it ambiguous as to whether or not he is alive in the remake.

<p>Sa'luk (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Orbach" title="Jerry Orbach">Jerry Orbach</a>) is the main antagonist of the <a href="/wiki/Aladdin_and_the_King_of_Thieves" title="Aladdin and the King of Thieves">third film</a>. He is a ruthless, aggressive brute, and he seems to have pleasure in killing. Sa'luk is the right-hand man of Cassim, the King of Thieves.
</p><p>After the incident at the wedding, Sa'luk tried to strike Cassim only for Aladdin to intervene. Cassim avoids having Aladdin killed by having him fight Sa'luk in an initiation duel. After Aladdin supposedly kills Sa'luk by causing him to fall into the sea, Cassim states that the Code of the 40 Thieves is clear on this point and states that he is in.
</p><p>Though Sa'luk survives and makes his way to Agrabah. Sa'luk gives the hideout's password to Razoul in exchange for immunity from prosecution. This led to 33 of the 40 Thieves getting arrested, though a guard tells Razoul that the Sultan will not sentence them until after Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding. Sa'luk was displeased that Cassim is not among them as he informs Razoul that Aladdin's father is the King of Thieves.
</p><p>Sa'luk heads back to Mount Sesame and rallies the 7 thieves that evaded capture to side with him. When Cassim and Iago return to the hideout, they are captured by Sa'luk and forced to call forth the Oracle who leads them to the Vanishing Isle where the Hand of Midas is located. During Aladdin and Cassim's fight with Sa'luk, the Hand of Midas is tossed where Sa'luk touched the hand part and is turned to gold.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Forty_Thieves">Forty Thieves</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Disney%27s_Aladdin_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=45" title="Edit section: Forty Thieves">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The Forty Thieves are a group of thieves and assassins that are led by Cassim with Sa'luk as his second-in-command. They make their headquarters in Mount Sesame by the sea where it can be accessed by saying "Open Sesame". That creates a path in the water to Mount Sesame. Cassim had a rule where its members are not to harm the innocent, much to the dismay of Sa'luk. Some of the minor unnamed members of the gang resemble many of Abis Mal's henchmen, as well as a few of the unnamed thieves who appeared at the Thieves' Quarters on the TV show, though it's not certain whether or not these are the same characters.
</p><p>The Forty Thieves are first seen when they crash Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding looking for the Oracle. They fled after Aladdin and his friends fended them off. After learning about Cassim being "trapped in their world," Aladdin finds the Forty Thieves' hideout and spies on them. When Sa'luk got tired of Cassim's rule and tried to attack him, Aladdin intervened and revealed to Cassim that he is his son. To evade having Aladdin executed, Cassim had Aladdin fight Sa'luk in an initiation duel. This fight was fierce until they end up on the cliffside where Sa'luk fell to his apparent death. The thieves pulled Aladdin up from the cliffside and brought him before Cassim. Cassim states to Aladdin "You killed Sa'luk. The Code of the 40 Thieves is clear on this point. You're in." The 40 Thieves then began singing "Welcome to the 40 Thieves."
</p><p>Sa'luk is shown to have survived the fall and made his way to Agrabah. In exchange for amnesty from arrest, Sa'luk tells Razoul how to get into Mount Sesame to catch the King of Thieves. After Aladdin and Cassim left for Agrabah, Razoul and his guards show up. When Razoul forgets how the password goes, Fazahl quoted to Razoul that he thought the password he was told was Open Sesame. This grants Razoul passage into Mount Sesame which led to 33 of the 40 Thieves being thrown in the dungeon. They were enraged at Sa'luk for setting them up as a guard tells Razoul that the Sultan will not be able to sentence them until after Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding. After stating to Razoul that Cassim is the King of Thieves, Sa'luk heads to Mount Sesame and persuades the 7 thieves that evaded capture that Cassim sold them out. When Sa'luk and the 7 thieves capture Cassim and Iago upon his return, they take their boat out to sea as they use Cassim to activate the Oracle in order to find the Hand of Midas. This takes them to the Vanishing Isle as Iago escapes to warn Aladdin. After Aladdin, Genie, Carpet, and Iago arrive, Genie fights some of them before working to keep the giant turtle from diving. When Cassim throws the Hand of Midas to the sea, it hits the Sa'luk's boat before landing in the water. This leaves the 7 thieves working to survive their boat's sinking as they are left stranded in the ocean.
