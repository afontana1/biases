<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Donelson_Forsyth" class="mw-redirect" title="Donelson Forsyth">Donelson Forsyth</a>, after submitting to group pressures, individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity. These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.
</p><p>When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing <i>compliance</i> or <i>acquiescence</i>.  In turn, <i>conversion</i>, otherwise known as <i>private acceptance</i>, involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.
</p><p>Another type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called <i>convergence</i>. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<sup id="cite_ref-Forsyth,_D._R._2009_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Forsyth,_D._R._2009-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display <i>independence</i>. <i>Independence</i>, or <i>dissent</i>, can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying <i><a href="/wiki/Anticonformity_(psychology)" title="Anticonformity (psychology)">anticonformity</a></i> or <i>counterconformity</i> which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.
</p><p>To conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the <i>Asch situation</i> or <a href="/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments" title="Asch conformity experiments">Asch conformity experiments</a>, primarily includes <i>compliance</i> and <i>independence</i>. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<sup id="cite_ref-Forsyth,_D._R._2009_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Forsyth,_D._R._2009-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the <a href="/wiki/Autokinetic_effect" title="Autokinetic effect">autokinetic effect</a>. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<sup id="cite_ref-Hogg_2005_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hogg_2005-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society, providing a common frame of reference for people.
</p><p>Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations. In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Solomon E. Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<sup id="cite_ref-Asch_1955_31–35_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Asch_1955_31–35-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial. On average people conformed one third of the time.<sup id="cite_ref-Asch_1955_31–35_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Asch_1955_31–35-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After his first test, Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects.
"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important – the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question. In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to 15 persons."<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject, the subject became more likely to conform. However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<sup id="cite_ref-Asch_1955_31–35_23-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Asch_1955_31–35-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Besides that, this experiment proved that conformity is powerful, but also fragile. It is powerful because just by having actors giving the wrong answer made the participant to also give the wrong answer, even though they knew it was not correct. It is also fragile, however, because in one of the variants for the experiment, one of the actors was supposed to give the correct answer, being an "ally" to the participant. With an ally, the participant was more likely to give the correct answer than he was before the ally. In addition, if the participant was able to write down the answer, instead of saying out loud, he was also more likely to put the correct answer. The reason for that is because he was not afraid of being different from the rest of the group since the answers were hidden.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Although Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology_(psychology)" class="mw-redirect" title="Social psychology (psychology)">social psychology</a> has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are <i>informational</i> conformity, or <a href="/wiki/Informational_social_influence" class="mw-redirect" title="Informational social influence">informational social influence</a>, and <i>normative</i> conformity, also called <a href="/wiki/Normative_social_influence" title="Normative social influence">normative social influence</a>.

There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> and conformity; the notion of "varieties" of conformity based upon "social influence" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.
</p><p>For Deutsch and Gérard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<sup id="cite_ref-Deutsch_1955_629–636_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Deutsch_1955_629–636-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality. A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to <a href="/wiki/Expert" title="Expert">experts</a> for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in <i>internalization</i> or <i>private acceptance</i>, where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<sup id="cite_ref-Hogg_2005_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hogg_2005-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<sup id="cite_ref-Hogg_2005_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hogg_2005-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Normative influence usually results in <i>public compliance</i>, doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al. argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection. See: <a href="/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments" title="Asch conformity experiments">Normative influence vs. referent informational influence</a>
</p><p>In a reinterpretation of the original data from these <a href="/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments" title="Asch conformity experiments">experiments</a> Hodges and Geyer (2006)<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.
By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.
</p><p>Deutsch &amp; Gérard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<sup id="cite_ref-Deutsch_1955_629–636_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Deutsch_1955_629–636-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Normative influence, a function of <a href="/wiki/Social_impact_theory" title="Social impact theory">social impact theory</a>, has three components.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> The <i>number of people</i> in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's <i>strength</i> is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. <i>Immediacy</i> is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Baron and his colleagues conducted a second <i>eyewitness study</i> that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.
</p><p>An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of <a href="/wiki/Friend" class="mw-redirect" title="Friend">friends</a> as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations. Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse, however, generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>

<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"/><div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Minority_influence" title="Minority influence">Minority influence</a></div>
<p>Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups, individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them. This is known as <i>minority influence</i>, a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed.
</p><p>Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single "bad apple" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well. In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex.

<p>Research has noted age differences in conformity. For example, research with Australian children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 discovered that conformity decreases with age.<sup id="cite_ref-WalkerMB_52-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WalkerMB-52">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages 18 to 91.<sup id="cite_ref-Pasupathi_53-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pasupathi-53">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> The results revealed a similar trend&#160;– older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants.
</p><p>In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status, age has also been argued to have status implications. Berger, Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students. Younger students, such as those in their first year in college, are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-Berger1980_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Berger1980-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, given these status roles, it would be expected that younger individuals (low status) conform to the majority whereas older individuals (high status) would be expected not to conform <sup id="cite_ref-Eagly1982_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Eagly1982-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup>

They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles.<sup id="cite_ref-Eagly1982_55-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Eagly1982-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup>  Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals.

</p><p>Research has also found that as individuals become more aware that they disagree with the majority they feel more pressure, and hence are more likely to conform to the decisions of the group.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup> Likewise, when responses must be made face-face, individuals increasingly conform, and therefore conformity increases as the anonymity of the response in a group decreases.
