<p>SM is considered to be outside of cognitive control and is instead an automatic response. The information represented in SM is the "raw data" which provides a snapshot of a person's overall sensory experience. Common features between each <a href="/wiki/Sensory_modality" class="mw-redirect" title="Sensory modality">sensory modality</a> have been identified; however, as experimental techniques advance, exceptions and additions to these general characteristics will surely evolve.  The auditory store, echoic memory, for example, has been shown to have a temporal characteristic in which the timing and <a href="/wiki/Tempo" title="Tempo">tempo</a> of a presented stimulus affects transfer into more stable forms of memory.<sup id="cite_ref-Istvan_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Istvan-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> 
Four common features have been identified for all forms of SM:<sup id="cite_ref-Istvan_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Istvan-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p>
<ol><li>The formation of a SM trace is only weakly dependent on attention to the stimulus.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The information stored in SM is modality specific. This means for example, that echoic memory is for the exclusive storage of auditory information, and haptic memory is for the exclusive storage of tactile information.</li>
<li>Each SM store represents an immense amount of detail resulting in very high resolution of information.</li>
<li>Each SM store is very brief and lasts a very short period of time. Once the SM trace has decayed or is replaced by a new memory, the information stored is no longer accessible and is ultimately lost. All SM stores have slightly different durations which is discussed in more detail on their <a href="#See_also">respective pages</a>.</li></ol>
<p>It is widely accepted that all forms of SM are very brief in duration; however, the approximated duration of each memory store is not static.  Iconic memory, for example, holds visual information for approximately 250 milliseconds.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  The SM is made up of spatial or categorical stores of different kinds of information, each subject to different rates of information processing and decay. The visual sensory store has a relatively high capacity, with the ability to hold up to 12 items.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Genetics also play a role in SM capacity; mutations to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a nerve growth factor, and <a href="/wiki/NMDA_receptor" title="NMDA receptor">N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors</a>, responsible for <a href="/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity" title="Synaptic plasticity">synaptic plasticity</a>, decrease iconic and echoic memory capacities respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>

Iconic memory was the first sensory store to be investigated with experiments dating back as far as 1740. One of the earliest investigations into this phenomenon was by Ján Andrej Segner, a German physicist and mathematician. In his experiment, Segner attached a glowing coal to a cart wheel and rotated the wheel at increasing speed until an unbroken circle of light was perceived by the observer. He calculated that the glowing coal needed to make a complete circle in under 100ms to achieve this effect, which he determined was the duration of this visual memory store. In 1960, George Sperling conducted a study where participants were shown a set of letters for a brief amount of time and were asked to recall the letters they were shown afterwards.  Participants were less likely to recall more letters when asked about the whole group of letters, but recalled more when asked about specific subgroups of the whole.  These findings suggest that iconic memory in humans has a large capacity, but decays very rapidly.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Another study set out to test the idea that visual sensory memory consists of coarse-grained and fine-grained memory traces using a mathematical model to quantify each.  The study suggested that the dual-trace model of visual memory out performed single-trace models.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Patients undergoing regional anesthesia can have incorrect, "phantom" perception of their limb positions during a procedure. A longstanding neurological explanation of this effect was that, without incoming signals from <a href="/wiki/Proprioception" title="Proprioception">proprioceptive</a> neurons, the limb perception system presented to consciousness a default, slightly flexed position, considered to be a universal, inborn "body schema".<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> However, more deliberate experimentation, varying patient limb position prior to anesthesia, has established that there is a proprioceptive memory store, which informs these perceptions.<sup id="cite_ref-Isaacson_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Isaacson-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> More task-oriented experimentation with limb position—asking subjects to return their arm to a remembered position—has revealed a rapidly decaying, high-precision memory available for two to four seconds, which is theorized to be the proprioceptive equivalent of iconic memory and echoic memory.<sup id="cite_ref-Brennan_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brennan-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>A somewhat different theory of proprioceptive memory has been put forward as an explanation of <a href="/wiki/Phantom_limb" title="Phantom limb">phantom limb</a> phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-Anderson-Barnes_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Anderson-Barnes-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> The hypothesis states that we remember limb positions which are used in common tasks, such driving, riding a bike, eating with a fork, etc. The formation of a "proprioceptive memory bank" over the course of our lives contributes to our proficiency with these tasks, and the ease with which they are performed. Memories of specific limb positions can also be associated with expected sensations, including pain. In the theory as described by Anderson-Barnes et al., these memories aid us to rapidly ascribe location and cause when pain does occur, especially pain caused by an overextended joint; and these memories also help us rapidly choose a motion which will relieve the pain. However, in the case of amputation, the remembered pain is being continually or intermittently ascribed to the perceived limb position, often because the most recent limb position prior to amputation was in fact painful. This pain, and the role of proprioceptive memory in perpetuating it, has been compared to <a href="/wiki/Tinnitus" title="Tinnitus">tinnitus</a><sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> and the role of echoic memory in its etiology.
