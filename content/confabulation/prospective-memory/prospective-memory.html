<p>There are two types of prospective memory: event-based and time-based prospective memory.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> <b>Event-based prospective memory</b> involves remembering to perform certain actions when specific circumstances occur. For example, driving past the local <a href="/wiki/Library" title="Library">library</a> cues the remembrance of the need to return an overdue <a href="/wiki/Book" title="Book">book</a>. <b>Time-based prospective memory</b> involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time.<sup id="cite_ref-MEMORYBOOK_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MEMORYBOOK-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> For example, seeing that it is 10:00 PM acts as a cue to watch a favorite <a href="/wiki/Television_show" title="Television show">television show</a>.

<h3><span id="The_preparatory_attentional_and_memory_.28PAM.29_theory"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_preparatory_attentional_and_memory_(PAM)_theory">The preparatory attentional and memory (PAM) theory</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Prospective_memory&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: The preparatory attentional and memory (PAM) theory">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The <b>preparatory attentional and memory</b> (PAM) theory proposes two types of processes involved in successful prospective memory performance.<sup id="cite_ref-MEMORYBOOK_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MEMORYBOOK-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The first component of this theory involves a monitoring process that begins when a person constructs an <a href="/wiki/Intention" title="Intention">intention</a> that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, similar to those used when maintaining attention, because there is a need for the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of <a href="/wiki/Retrospective_memory" title="Retrospective memory">retrospective memory</a> processes.<sup id="cite_ref-SMITH_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SMITH-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal and not the other options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the monitoring process is needed to be able to remember to perform this action at the correct condition or <a href="/wiki/Time" title="Time">time</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-SMITH_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SMITH-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>According to this theory, prospective memory should be enhanced when complete attention is given to the desired task than when attention is divided among multiple tasks. Research conducted by <a href="/wiki/Mark_A._McDaniel" title="Mark A. McDaniel">McDaniel</a> et al. (1998) attempted to prove that prospective memory performance is better on focused tasks as opposed to those where attention is split.<sup id="cite_ref-PERCEPTION_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PERCEPTION-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Subjects completed a prospective memory task in either a condition where full attention was given or a condition where attention was divided on other tasks. The results were consistent with the PAM theory, showing that participants' prospective memory performance was better with full attention.<sup id="cite_ref-PERCEPTION_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PERCEPTION-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>However, there is a lot of scepticism that the rather complex mechanisms of the PAM theory are required for all, sometimes mundane, prospective memory tasks. In research by Reese and Cherry (2002), participants formed an intention to act in the future, but were interrupted prior to acting on their intention when the cue was present. When participants were asked their thoughts at the moment of interruption, only 2% reported that they were thinking of the original intention.<sup id="cite_ref-REESE_2002_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-REESE_2002-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>  This demonstrated evidence against the PAM theory, that there is constant maintenance from the time of constructing the intention to acting upon it at the right circumstance.

<p>Further research conducted by Einstein and McDaniel in 1990, found that subjects during prospective memory tasks reported that their  intention often "popped" into mind, instead of being constantly monitored and consciously maintained.<sup id="cite_ref-EIN_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EIN-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Along similar lines, a theory was proposed in 2000, called the <b>reflexive-associative theory</b>, which states that when people create an intention for a prospective memory task, they make an association between the target cue and the intended action. Later when the target cue occurs, the automatic associative-memory system triggers the retrieval of the intended action and brings it back into conscious awareness.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, as long as the target cue occurs, the association previously made will initiate the retrieval of the intended action, regardless of whether the intention is in consciousness.

<p>Another theory that has been used to explain the mechanisms of prospective memory is the <b>multi-process model</b> proposed by McDaniel and Einstein (2005).<sup id="cite_ref-ELEVEN_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ELEVEN-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> This theory states that prospective memory retrieval does not always need an active monitoring process but can occur spontaneously (i.e., the occurrence of a cue can cause the intention to be retrieved, even when no preparatory attentional processes are engaged). Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory. Further, it was believed that it would be maladaptive to rely solely on active monitoring because it requires a lot of attentional resources. This may potentially interfere with other forms of processing that are required for different tasks during the retention interval.<sup id="cite_ref-ELEVEN_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ELEVEN-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Prospective memory cues will lead to spontaneous retrieval of an intention when at least one of four conditions is met: the cue and target action are highly associated with each other, the cue is salient, the other processes performed during the period between cue and action of the prospective memory task direct attention to relevant cue features (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Task_appropriate_processing" title="Task appropriate processing">task appropriate processing</a>), or the intended action is simple. Further research has found that although many aspects of prospective memory tasks are automatic, they do involve a small amount of processing.<sup id="cite_ref-TWELVE_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWELVE-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> An experiment conducted by Einstein et al. (2005) found that some participants performed slower on a filler task when performing a prospective memory task at the same time.<sup id="cite_ref-TWELVE_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWELVE-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Even though some of the participants did not engage in active monitoring, they showed nearly the same rate of success on the task, demonstrating the use of multiple processes for prospective memory performance.

There were no significant differences observed between pregnant and non-pregnant women for event-based prospective memory tasks, but there were clear hindrances in performance for pregnant women in time-based prospective memory tasks such as a job deadline.

There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, they will not be motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues and the memory is more likely to be forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.
