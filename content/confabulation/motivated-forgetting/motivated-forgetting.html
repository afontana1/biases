<p>Neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot was the first to do research into <a href="/wiki/Hysteria" title="Hysteria">hysteria</a> as a psychological disorder in the late 19th century. <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Breuer" title="Joseph Breuer">Joseph Breuer</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Janet" title="Pierre Janet">Pierre Janet</a> continued with the research that Charcot began on hysteria. These three psychologists determined that hysteria was an intense emotional reaction to some form of severe psychological disturbance, and they proposed that incest and other sexual traumas were the most likely cause of hysteria.<sup id="cite_ref-Stoler_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stoler-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The treatment that Freud, Breuer, and Pierre agreed upon was named the <i>talking cure</i> and was a method of encouraging patients to recover and discuss their painful memories. During this time, Janet created the term <a href="/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology)" title="Dissociation (psychology)">dissociation</a> which is referred to as a lack of integration amongst various memories. He used dissociation to describe the way in which traumatizing memories are stored separately from other memories.<sup id="cite_ref-Stoler_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stoler-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The idea of motivated forgetting began with the philosopher <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> in 1894.<sup id="cite_ref-N_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-N-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud had similar views on the idea of repression of memories as a form of self-preservation. Nietzsche wrote that man must forget in able to move forward. He stated that this process is active, in that we forget specific events as a defense mechanism.<sup id="cite_ref-N_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-N-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The publication of Freud's famous paper, "The Aetiology of Hysteria", in 1896 led to much controversy regarding the topic of these traumatic memories. Freud stated that <a href="/wiki/Neuroses" class="mw-redirect" title="Neuroses">neuroses</a> were caused by repressed sexual memories,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> which suggested that incest and sexual abuse must be common throughout upper and middle class Europe. The psychological community did not accept Freud's ideas, and years passed without further research on the topic.
</p><p>It was during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> that interest in memory disturbances was piqued again. During this time, many cases of memory loss appeared among war veterans, especially those who had experienced <a href="/wiki/Shell_shock" title="Shell shock">shell shock</a>. Hypnosis and drugs became popular for the treatment of hysteria during the war.<sup id="cite_ref-Stoler_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stoler-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The term <a href="/wiki/Post_traumatic_stress_disorder" class="mw-redirect" title="Post traumatic stress disorder">post traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) was introduced upon the appearance of similar cases of memory disturbances from veterans of the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>. Forgetting, or the inability to recall a portion of a traumatic event, was considered a key factor for the diagnosis of PTSD.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Ann_Burgess" title="Ann Burgess">Ann Burgess</a> and Lynda Holmstrom<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> looked into trauma related memory loss in rape victims during the 1970s. This began a large outpouring of stories related to childhood sexual abuse. It took until 1980 to determine that memory loss due to all severe traumas was the same set of processes.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation" title="False Memory Syndrome Foundation">False Memory Syndrome Foundation</a> (FMSF) was created in 1992 as a response to the large number of memories claimed to be recovered.<sup id="cite_ref-Stoler_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stoler-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> The FMSF was created to oppose the idea that memories could be recovered using specific techniques; instead, its members believed that the "memories" were actually <a href="/wiki/Confabulation" title="Confabulation">confabulations</a> created through the inappropriate use of techniques such as hypnosis.

<p>There are many theories which are related to the process of motivated forgetting.
</p><p>The main theory, the <i><b>motivated forgetting theory</b></i>, suggests that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. Painful and disturbing memories are made unconscious and very difficult to retrieve, but still remain in storage.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> <i>Retrieval Suppression</i> (the ability to utilise inhibitory control to prevent memories from being recalled into consciousness) <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> is one way in which we are able to stop the retrieval of unpleasant memories using cognitive control. This theory was tested by Anderson and Green using the Think/No-Think paradigm.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Decay_theory" title="Decay theory"><b>decay theory</b></a></i> is another theory of forgetting which refers to the loss of memory over time. When information enters memory, <a href="/wiki/Neuron" title="Neuron">neurons</a> are activated. These memories are retained as long as the neurons remain active. Activation can be maintained through rehearsal or frequent recall. If activation is not maintained, the memory trace fades and decays. This usually occurs in <i>short term memory</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> The decay theory is a controversial topic amongst modern psychologists. Bahrick and Hall disagree with the decay theory. They have claimed that people can remember algebra they learnt from school even years later.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> A refresher course brought their skill back to a high standard relatively quick. These findings suggest that there may be more to the theory of trace decay in human memory.
</p><p>Another theory of motivated forgetting is <i><b>interference theory</b></i>, which posits that subsequent learning can interfere with and degrade a person's memories.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> This theory was tested by giving participants ten nonsense syllables. Some of the participants then slept after viewing the syllables, while the other participants carried on their day as usual. The results of this experiment showed that people who stayed awake had a poor recall of the syllables, while the sleeping participants remembered the syllables better. This could have occurred due to the fact that the sleeping subjects had no interference during the experiment, while the other subjects did. There are two types of interference; <a href="/wiki/Proactive_interference" class="mw-redirect" title="Proactive interference">proactive interference</a> and <a href="/wiki/Retroactive_interference" class="mw-redirect" title="Retroactive interference">retroactive interference</a>. Proactive interference occurs when you are unable to learn a new task due to the interference of an old task that has already been learned. Research has been done to show that students who study similar subjects at the same time often experience interference.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Retroactive interference occurs when you forget a previously learnt task due to the learning of a new task.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i><b>Gestalt theory of forgetting</b></i>, created by <a href="/wiki/Gestalt_psychology" title="Gestalt psychology">Gestalt psychology</a>, suggests that memories are forgotten through <a href="/wiki/Distortion" title="Distortion">distortion</a>. This is also called <a href="/wiki/False_memory_syndrome" title="False memory syndrome">false memory syndrome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> This theory states that when memories lack detail, other information is put in to make the memory a whole. This leads to the incorrect recall of memories.

<p>The term recovered memory, also known in some cases as a false memory, refers to the theory that some memories can be repressed by an individual and then later recovered. <a href="/wiki/Recovered_memories" class="mw-redirect" title="Recovered memories">Recovered memories</a> are often used as evidence in a case where the defendant is accused of either sexual or some other form of child abuse, and recently recovered a repressed memory of the abuse. This has created much controversy, and as the use of this form of evidence rises in the courts, the question has arisen as to whether or not recovered memories actually exist.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> In an effort to determine the factuality of false memories, several laboratories have developed paradigms in order to test whether or not false repressed memories could be purposefully implanted within a subject. As a result, the verbal paradigm was developed. This paradigm dictates that if someone is presented a number of words associated with a single non-presented word, then they are likely to falsely remember that word as presented.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Similar to the verbal paradigm is <a href="/wiki/Fuzzy-trace_theory" title="Fuzzy-trace theory">fuzzy-trace theory</a>, which dictates that one encodes two separate things about a memory: the actual information itself and the semantic information surrounding it (or the gist).<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> If we are given a series of semantic information surrounding a false event, such as time and location, then we are more likely to falsely remember an event as occurring.<sup id="cite_ref-P_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-P-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Tied to that is <i>Source Monitoring Theory</i>, which, among other things, dictates that emotionally salient events tend to increase the power of the memory that forms from said event. Emotion also weakens our ability to remember the source from the event.<sup id="cite_ref-P_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-P-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Source monitoring is centralized to the <a href="/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex" title="Anterior cingulate cortex">anterior cingulate cortex</a>.
</p><p>Repressed memory therapy has come under heavy criticism as it is said that it follows very similar techniques that are used to purposefully implant a memory in an adult. These include: asking questions on the gist of an event, creating imagery about said gist, and attempting to discover the event from there. This, when compounded with the fact that most repressed memories are emotionally salient, the likelihood of source confusion is high. One might assume that a child abuse case one heard about actually happened to one, remembering it with the imagery established through the therapy.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The idea of <a href="/wiki/Psychological_repression" class="mw-redirect" title="Psychological repression">psychological repression</a> was developed in 1915 as an automatic defensive mechanism based on Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic model in which people subconsciously push unpleasant or intolerable thoughts and feelings into their unconscious.<sup id="cite_ref-Freud_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Freud-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When situations or memories occur that we are unable to cope with, we push them away. It is a primary <a href="/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego" title="Id, ego and super-ego">ego</a> defence mechanism that many psychotherapists readily accept.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>  There have been numerous studies which have supported the psychoanalytic theory that states that murder, childhood trauma and sexual abuse can be repressed for a period of time and then recovered in therapy.<sup id="cite_ref-Bower_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bower-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Repressed memories can influence behavior unconsciously, manifesting themselves in our discussions, dreams, and emotional reactions. An example of repression would include a child who is abused by a parent, who later has no recollection of the events, but has trouble forming relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-Bower_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bower-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Freud suggested <a href="/wiki/Psychoanalysis" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> as a treatment method for repressed memories.

</p><p>In order to suppress a thought, one must (a) plan to suppress the thought and (b) carry out that plan by suppressing all other manifestations of the thought, including the original plan.<sup id="cite_ref-Freud_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Freud-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Thought suppression seems to entail a state of knowing and not knowing all at once.

<p>Suppression encompasses the term directed forgetting, also known as <a href="/wiki/Intentional_forgetting" class="mw-redirect" title="Intentional forgetting">intentional forgetting</a>. This term refers to forgetting which is initiated by a conscious goal to forget.<sup id="cite_ref-Bad_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bad-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Intentional forgetting is important at the individual level: suppressing an unpleasant memory of a trauma or a loss that is particularly painful.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i>directed forgetting paradigm</i> is a psychological term meaning that information can be forgotten upon instruction.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> There are two methods of the directed forgetting paradigm: item method and list method. In both methods, the participants are instructed to forget some items, the to-be-forgotten items and the to-be-remembered items.
</p><p>In the item method of directed forgetting, participants are presented with a series of random to-be-remembered and to-be-forgotten items.<sup id="cite_ref-MacLeod_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MacLeod-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> After each item an instruction is given to the participant to either remember it, or forget it. After the study phase, when participants are told to remember or to forget subsets of the items, the participants are given a test of all the words presented.<sup id="cite_ref-MacLeod_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MacLeod-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> The participants were unaware that they would be tested on the to-be-forgotten items. The recall for the to-be-forgotten words are often significantly impaired compared to the to-be-remembered words. The directed forgetting effect has also been demonstrated on recognition tests. For this reason researchers believe that the item method affects episodic encoding.<sup id="cite_ref-MacLeod_32-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MacLeod-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In the list method procedure, the instructions to forget are given only after half of the list has been presented. These instructions are given once in the middle of the list, and once at the end of the list.<sup id="cite_ref-MacLeod_32-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MacLeod-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> The participants are told that the first list they had to study was just a practice list, and to focus their attention on the upcoming list. After the participants have conducted the study phase for the first list, a second list is presented. A final test is then given, sometimes for only the first list and other times for both lists. The participants are asked to remember all the words they studied. When participants are told they are able to forget the first list, they remember less in this list and remember more in the second list.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> List method directed forgetting demonstrates the ability to intentionally reduce memory retrieval.<sup id="cite_ref-Bad_29-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bad-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> To support this theory, researchers did an experiment in which they asked participants to record 2 unique events that happened to them each day over a 5-day period in a journal. After these five days, the participants were asked to either remember or forget the events on these days. They were then asked to repeat the process for another five days, after which they were told to remember all the events in both weeks, regardless of earlier instructions. The participants that were part of the forget group had had worse recall for the first week compared to the second week.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>There are two theories that can explain directed forgetting: retrieval inhibition hypothesis and context shift hypothesis. 
</p><p>The <i>Retrieval Inhibition Hypothesis</i> states that the instruction to forget the first list hinders memory of the list-one items.<sup id="cite_ref-Bad_29-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bad-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> This hypothesis suggests that directed forgetting only reduces the retrieval of the unwanted memories, not causing permanent damage.

<p>The repression of memories was the prescribed treatment by many doctors and psychiatrists, and was deemed effective for the management of these memories. Unfortunately, many soldiers' traumas were much too vivid and intense to be dealt with in this manner, as described in the journal of <a href="/wiki/W._H._R._Rivers" title="W. H. R. Rivers">Dr. Rivers</a>. One soldier, who entered the hospital after losing consciousness due to a shell explosion, is described as having a generally pleasant demeanor. This was disrupted by his sudden onsets of depression occurring approximately every 10 days. This intense depression, leading to suicidal feelings, rendered him unfit to return to war. It soon became apparent that these symptoms were due to the patient's repressed thoughts and apprehensions about returning to war. Dr. Smith suggested that this patient face his thoughts and allow himself to deal with his feelings and anxieties. Although this caused the soldier to take on a significantly less cheery state, he only experienced one more minor bout of depression.

<p>Many cases of motivated forgetting have been reported in regards to recovered memories of childhood abuse. Many cases of abuse, particularly those performed by relatives or figures of authority, can lead to memory suppression and repression of varying amounts of time. One study indicates that 31% of abuse victims were aware of at least some forgetting of their abuse<sup id="cite_ref-Bowman_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bowman-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> and a collaboration of seven studies has shown that one eighth to one quarter of abuse victims have periods of complete unawareness (amnesia) of the incident or series of events.<sup id="cite_ref-Bowman_51-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bowman-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> There are many factors associated with forgetting abuse including: younger age at onset, threats/intense emotions, more types of abuse, and increased number of abusers.<sup id="cite_ref-Herman_52-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Herman-52">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup>  Cued recovery has been shown in 90% of cases, usually with one specific event triggering the memory.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> For example, the return of incest memories have been shown to be brought on by television programs about incest, the death of the perpetrator, the abuse of the subject's own child, and seeing the site of abuse.<sup id="cite_ref-Bowman_51-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bowman-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> In a study by Herman and Schatzow, confirming evidence was found for the same proportion of individuals with continuous memories of abuse as those individuals who had recovered memories. 74% of cases from each group were confirmed.<sup id="cite_ref-Herman_52-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Herman-52">&#91;52&#93;</a></sup> Cases of Mary de Vries and Claudia show examples of confirmed recovered memories of sexual abuse.

<p>Motivated forgetting and repressed memories have become a very controversial issue within the court system. Courts are currently dealing with historical cases, in particular a relatively new phenomenon known as <i>historic child sexual abuse</i> (HCSA). HCSA refers to allegations of child abuse having occurred several years prior to the time at which they are being prosecuted.<sup id="cite_ref-Jo_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jo-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Unlike most American states, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand have no <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_limitations" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> to limit the prosecution of historical offenses. Therefore, legal decision-makers in each case need to evaluate the credibility of allegations that may go back many years. It is nearly impossible to provide evidence for many of these historical abuse cases. It is therefore extremely important to consider the credibility of the witness and accused in making a decision regarding guiltiness of the defendant.<sup id="cite_ref-Stephen_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stephen-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>One of the main arguments against the credibility of historical allegations, involving the retrieval of repressed memories, is found in false memory syndrome. False memory syndrome claims that through therapy and the use of suggestive techniques, clients mistakenly come to believe that they were sexually abused as children.<sup id="cite_ref-Jo_54-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jo-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In the United States, the statute of limitations requires that legal action be taken within three to five years of the incident of interest. Exceptions are made for minors, where the child has until they reach eighteen years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-Memon_56-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Memon-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>There are many factors related to the age at which child abuse cases may be presented. These include bribes, threats, dependency on the abuser, and ignorance of the child to their state of harm.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> All of these factors may lead a person, who has been harmed, to require more time to present their case. As well as seen in the case below of Jane Doe and Jane Roe, time may be required if memories of the abuse have been repressed or suppressed. In 1981, the statute was adjusted to make exceptions for those individuals who were not consciously aware that their situation was harmful. This rule was called the <i>discovery rule</i>. This rule is to be used by the court as deemed necessary by the Judge of that case.<sup id="cite_ref-Memon_56-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Memon-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup>
