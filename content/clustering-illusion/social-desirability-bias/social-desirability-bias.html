<p>In <a href="/wiki/Social_research" title="Social research">social science research</a>, <b>social-desirability bias</b> is a type of <a href="/wiki/Response_bias" title="Response bias">response bias</a> that is the tendency of <a href="/wiki/Survey_methodology" title="Survey methodology">survey</a> respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others.<sup id="cite_ref-Krumpal2013_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Krumpal2013-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It can take the form of over-reporting "good behavior" or under-reporting "bad", or undesirable behavior. The tendency poses a serious problem with conducting research with <a href="/wiki/Self-report_study" title="Self-report study">self-reports</a>. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average tendencies as well as individual differences.

<p>Topics where socially desirable responding (SDR) is of special concern are self-reports of abilities, personality, sexual behavior, and drug use. When confronted with the question "How often do you <a href="/wiki/Masturbation" title="Masturbation">masturbate</a>?," for example, respondents may be pressured by the societal <a href="/wiki/Taboo" title="Taboo">taboo</a> against masturbation, and either under-report the frequency or avoid answering the question. Therefore, the mean rates of masturbation derived from self-report surveys are likely to be severely underestimated.
</p><p>When confronted with the question, "Do you use drugs/illicit substances?" the respondent may be influenced by the fact that <a href="/wiki/Controlled_substance" title="Controlled substance">controlled substances</a>, including the more commonly used <a href="/wiki/Marijuana" class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>, are generally illegal. Respondents may feel pressured to deny any drug use or <a href="/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)" title="Rationalization (psychology)">rationalize</a> it, e.g. "I only smoke marijuana when my friends are around." The bias can also influence reports of number of sexual partners. In fact, the bias may operate in opposite directions for different subgroups: Whereas men tend to inflate the numbers, women tend to underestimate theirs. In either case, the mean reports from both groups are likely to be distorted by social desirability bias.

<p>In 1953, Allen L. Edwards introduced the notion of social desirability to psychology, demonstrating the role of social desirability in the measurement of personality traits. He demonstrated that social desirability ratings of personality trait descriptions are very highly correlated with the probability that a subsequent group of people will endorse these trait self-descriptions. In his first demonstration of this pattern, the correlation between one group of college students’ social desirability ratings of a set of traits and the probability that college students in a second group would endorse self-descriptions describing the same traits was so high that it could distort the meaning of the personality traits. In other words, do these self-descriptions describe personality traits or social desirability?<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Edwards subsequently developed the first Social Desirability Scale, a set of 39, true-false questions extracted from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), questions that judges could, with high agreement, order according to their social desirability.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> These items were subsequently found to be very highly correlated with a wide range of measurement scales, MMPI personality and diagnostic scales.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The SDS is also highly correlated with the Beck Hopelessness Inventory.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The fact that people differ in their tendency to engage in socially desirable responding (SDR) is a special concern to those measuring individual differences with self-reports. Individual differences in SDR make it difficult to distinguish those people with good traits who are responding factually from those distorting their answers in a positive direction.
</p><p>When SDR cannot be eliminated, researchers may resort to evaluating the tendency and then control for it. A separate SDR measure must be administered together with the primary measure (test or interview) aimed at the subject matter of the research/investigation. The key assumption is that respondents who answer in a socially desirable manner on that scale are also responding desirably to all self-reports throughout the study.
</p><p>In some cases the entire questionnaire package from high scoring respondents may simply be discarded. Alternatively, respondents' answers on the primary questionnaires may be statistically adjusted commensurate with their SDR tendencies. For example, this adjustment is performed automatically in the standard scoring of MMPI scales.
</p><p>The major concern with SDR scales is that they confound style with content. After all, people actually differ in the degree to which they possess desirable traits (e.g. nuns versus criminals). Consequently, measures of social desirability confound true differences with social-desirability bias.

<p>Until the 1990s, the most commonly used measure of socially desirable responding was the <a href="/wiki/Marlowe%E2%80%93Crowne_Social_Desirability_Scale" title="Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale">Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Crowne_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Crowne-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> The original version comprised 33 True-False items.

</p><p>In 1991, <a href="/wiki/Delroy_L._Paulhus" title="Delroy L. Paulhus">Delroy L.

<p>"Extreme-response style" (ERS) takes the form of exaggerated-extremity preference, e.g. for '1' or '7' on 7-point scales. Its converse, 'moderacy bias' entails a preference for middle-range (or midpoint) responses (e.g. 3–5 on 7-point scales).
</p><p>"Acquiescence" (ARS) is the tendency to respond to items with agreement/affirmation independent of their content ("yea"-saying).
</p><p>These kinds of response styles differ from social-desirability bias in that they are unrelated to the question's content and may be present in both socially neutral and in socially favorable or unfavorable contexts, whereas SDR is, by definition, tied to the latter.
